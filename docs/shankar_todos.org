** Developments
   
*** Argumentation workflow


**** Documentation/Visualization
***** TODO fill up pydocstrings in appropriate style for all functions
***** TODO check that training script only executes corpus2tokenids if data missing
***** TODO add workflow for plotting results/data and figure out optparse for R
***** TODO fix up all readmes for clarity, add section for final evaluation on UNSC corpus
***** TODO update all information to indicate procedures and articles involved, so users can find relevant information
***** make final pull request when all is complete

**** Sequence encoding
***** TODO need to split UNSC smaller speech segments or paragraphs to pass into pipeline
***** simple (task 1) -> 1: claim, 2: premise, 3: non-argument
***** tree (task 2) -> adjacency matrix connecting to various heads which could be claims or connecting premise
***** minor debiasing done with removal of capital references

**** Architecture
***** limited time issue: make homogeneous train/validation/test datasets for appropriate evaluation
***** limited time issue: multi-task setting with argumentation tree
***** limited time issue: develop gradient accumulator/checkpointer in optimizer to save memory and use most of data available

**** Paper
***** motivate with all methods tried
***** mention domain debiasing with removal of references
***** compare with scores in paper and talk about how paper made much simplifications
***** think about all other optimizations worth mentioning, talk about problem with size 128 reduction
***** mention all limitations and recommendations for things to do; along with using pytorch instead of tensorflow
