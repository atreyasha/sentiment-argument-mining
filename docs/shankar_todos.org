** Developments
   
*** Argumentation workflow

**** Architecture
***** TODO first develop full baseline for task 1, then proceed to task 2
***** TODO add tasks to training options, also to output files
***** develop gradient accumulator/checkpointer in optimizer to save memory and use most of data available      
***** make homogeneous train/validation/test datasets for appropriate evaluation

**** Domain debiasing
***** perhaps dropout would assist in training

**** Sequence encoding
***** simple (task 1) -> 1: claim, 2: premise, 3: non-argument
***** tree (task 2) -> adjacency matrix connecting to various heads which could be claims or connecting premise
***** need to split UNSC smaller speech segments or paragraphs to pass into pipeline

**** Documentation
***** fix up all readmes for clarity
***** fill up pydocstrings in appropriate style for all functions
***** add all dependencies and information on how to install, test venv on cluster
***** add information on init.sh and how to use
