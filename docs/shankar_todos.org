# TODO try purely character transformer model first, then extend to others
# TODO might be fun to try small and easy example and slowly extend out
# consider using transformer xl for decoder, try out basic stuff in keras first
# clear splits wetween segments and how to represent this clearly
# TODO ultimately remove capital names and references to reduce bias
# think of other bias reduction techniques later on once annotated
# TODO add more possibilites of data to return

# 1: claim
# 2: claim connecting premise
# 3: premise connecting premise (behind)
# 4. no tag
# 5. void

# remove all delimiters after processing, it cannot be encoded
# TODO: convert dataset to both word and character level for first task
# TODO: stick to uncased data for ease, split into window and exact variant
# TODO: or perhaps go straight to joint tas?

*** Argumentation workflow

**** Architecture
***** TODO explore different tasks -> single/double candidate and span idenitfication (most important), or three/four-way joint model
***** TODO try novel architectures for seq2seq task, egs. GRU, transformer, BERT pre-trained models
***** if working with three-way task, need to think of how to pass a gradient on non-existent examples -> perhaps some kind of negative sampling procedure

**** Sequence encoding
***** TODO make datasets first with single and dual view (most important), and alternatively think of how to encode a tree for training (additional for three/four-way model)
***** TODO make character and word representations with both cased and non-cased views -> will amount to 2^3=8 different datasets
***** need to split into smaller speech segments or paragraphs to pass into pipeline

**** Ideas to innovate
***** experiment specific entity/token masking to prevent domain-specific bias from training vocabulary
***** add different classes in unknown vocabulary -> such as unknown noun, unknown adjective etc.

**** Extra steps
***** ibm argumentation dataset
***** coreference resolution for tree structures
***** try genereous claims and premises creation and map via negative sampling to actual trees and redundant candidates

**** Documentation
***** add all dependencies and information on how to install
***** add information on init.sh and how to use
