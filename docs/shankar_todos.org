** Developments
 
*** Argumentation workflow
    
**** Documentation/Visualization
***** TODO push final paper and bibtex when all is done, add global references to results from paper
***** TODO possibly improve final output and format to all claims and premises extracted from speeches
***** add script to compute classification report of best model at the end of training
***** add test scripts to ensure constant sanity checks, or test manually on jarvis
 
**** Sequence encoding
***** simple (task 1) -> 1: claim, 2: premise, 3: non-argument
***** tree (task 2) -> adjacency matrix connecting to various heads which could be claims or connecting premise
***** minor debiasing done with removal of capital references

**** Architecture
***** limited time issue: make homogeneous train/validation/test datasets for appropriate evaluation
***** limited time issue: multi-task setting with argumentation tree
***** limited time issue: develop gradient accumulator/checkpointer in optimizer to save memory and use most of data available
