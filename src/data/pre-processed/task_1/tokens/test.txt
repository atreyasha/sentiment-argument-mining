the	C

it	N

we	C
also	C

that	N

mobilized	P

We	P

made	P

what	P
we	P

for	P

a	P
serious	P

we	C

what	C
we	C

n't	C

to	C

just	N
briefly	N

I	N

uh	P
-	P
the	P
second	P

that	P

makes	P
mistakes	P

I	N
think	N
the	P
first	P
one	P
was	P

the	P
unwarranted	P

that	P
Israel	P
was	P
a	P

a	P
military	P
burden	P

the	P

apologized	P

it	P

uh	N
-	N
something	C
,	C
though	C
,	C
that	C
I	C
think	C
uh	C
-	C
is	C
indicative	C

the	C
need	C
among	C
the	C

a	C

You	N

call	N
that	N
the	N
people	N
amendment	N
.	N
I	N
think	N
if	P
you	P
really	P
believe	P
that	P
the	P
people	P
of	P
a	P
state	P
ought	P
to	P
make	P
a	P
decision	P
on	P
a	P
matter	P
of	P
this	P
kind	P
that	N
uh	N
-	N
we	C
ought	C
to	C
have	C
a	C
federal	C
constitutional	C
amendment	C
that	C
would	C
permit	C
each	C
one	C
of	C
the	C
fifty	C
states	C
to	C
make	C
the	C
choice	C
.	N
Uh	N
-	N
I	C
think	C
this	C
is	C
a	C
responsible	C
and	C
a	C
proper	C
way	C
to	C
proceed	C
.	N
Uhh	N
-	N
I	C
believe	C
also	C
that	C
uh	C
-	C
there	C
is	C
some	C
merit	C
to	C
a	C
-	C
an	C
amendment	C
that	C
uh	C
-	C
uh	C
-	C
Senator	C
Everett	C
Dirksen	C
uh	C
-	C
proposed	C
very	C
frequently	C
,	C
an	C
amendment	C
that	C
would	C
uh	C
-	C
change	C
the	C
court	C
decision	C
as	C
far	C
as	C
voluntary	C
prayer	C
in	C
public	C
schools	C
.	N
Uh	N
-	N
it	P
seems	P
to	P
me	P
that	P
there	P
should	P
have	P
-	P
be	P
an	P
opportunity	P
,	P
uh	P
-	P
as	P
long	P
as	P
it	P
's	P
voluntary	P
,	P
as	P
long	P
as	P
there	P
is	P
no	P
uh	P
-	P
compulsion	P
whatsoever	P
,	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
an	P
individual	P
ought	P
to	P
have	P
that	P
right	P
.	N
So	N
in	C
those	C
two	C
cases	C
I	C
think	C
uh	C
-	C
such	C
uh	C
-	C
a	C
constitutional	C
amendment	C
would	C
be	C
proper	C
,	N
and	N
I	C
really	C
do	C
n't	C
think	C
in	C
either	C
case	C
they	C
're	C
trivial	C
matters	C

I	N
think	N
they	P
're	P
matters	P
of	P
very	P
deep	P
conviction	P

as	P
far	P
as	P
many	P
,	P
many	P
people	P
in	P
this	P

believe	P
.	N
And	N
therefore	N
,	N
they	C
should	C
n't	C
be	C
treated	C
lightly	C

But	N
they	P
're	P
matters	P
that	P
are	P
ah	P
-	P
important	P

And	N
in	C
those	C

I	C
would	C

OBAMA	N

My	N
definition	N

here	N
's	N
what	N
I	C
can	C
tell	C
the	C
American	C
people	C
:	C
95	C
percent	C
of	C
you	C
will	C
get	C
a	C

And	N
if	C
you	C
make	C
less	C

less	C
than	C
a	C
quarter-million	C

then	C
you	C
will	C
not	C
see	C
one	C

worth	C
of	C

increase	C

Now	N
,	N
John	P

the	P
fact	P
that	P

on	P
paper	P
are	P
high	P
in	P
this	P
country	P
,	N
and	N
he	C
's	C
absolutely	C
right	C
.	N
Here	C
's	C
the	C
problem	C
:	C
There	C
are	C
so	C
many	C
loopholes	C
that	C
have	C
been	C
written	C
into	C
the	C
tax	C
code	C
,	N
oftentimes	N
with	N
support	N
of	N
Senator	N
McCain	N
,	N
that	C
we	C
actually	C
see	C
our	C
businesses	C
pay	C
effectively	C
one	C
of	C
the	C
lowest	C
tax	C
rates	C
in	C
the	C
world	C
.	N
And	N
what	N
that	N
means	N
,	N
then	N
,	N
is	N
that	N
there	C
are	C
people	C
out	C
there	C
who	C
are	C
working	C
every	C
day	C
,	C
who	C
are	C
not	C
getting	C
a	C
tax	C
cut	C
,	C
and	C
you	C
want	C
to	C
give	C
them	C
more	C
.	N
It	N
's	N
not	N
like	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
close	N
the	N
loopholes	N
.	N
You	P
just	P
want	P
to	P
add	P
an	P
additional	P
tax	P
cut	P
over	P
the	P
loopholes	P
.	N
And	N
that	C
's	C
a	C
problem	C
.	N
Just	N
one	N
last	N
point	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
,	N
since	N
Senator	N
McCain	N
talked	N
about	N
providing	N
a	N
$	N
5,000	N
health	N
credit	N
.	N
Now	N
,	N
what	N
he	P
does	P
n't	P
tell	P
you	P
is	P
that	P
he	P
intends	P
to	P
,	P
for	P
the	P
first	P
time	P
in	P
history	P
,	P
tax	P
health	P
benefits	P
.	N
So	N
you	P
may	P
end	P
up	P
getting	P
a	P
$	P
5,000	P
tax	P
credit	P
.	N
Here	C
's	C
the	C
only	C
problem	C

on	C
the	C

certainly	C
the	C

in	N

it	C

protect	P
themselves	P
.	N
But	N
there	P
have	P
been	P
too	P
many	P
instances	P
during	P
the	P
course	P
of	P
my	P
presidency	P
,	P
where	P
I	P
've	P
had	P
to	P
comfort	P
families	P
who	P
have	P
lost	P
somebody	P
.	N
Most	N
recently	N
out	N
in	N
Aurora	N
.	N
You	N
know	N
,	N
just	N
a	P
couple	P
of	P
weeks	P
ago	P
,	P
actually	P
,	P
probably	P
about	P
a	P
month	P
,	P
I	P
saw	P
a	P
mother	P
,	P
who	P
I	P
had	P
met	P
at	P
the	P
bedside	P
of	P
her	P
son	P
,	P
who	P
had	P
been	P
shot	P
in	P
that	P
theater	P
.	N
And	N
her	N
son	N
had	N
been	N
shot	N
through	N
the	N
head	N
.	N
And	N
we	N
spent	N
some	N
time	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
said	N
a	N
prayer	N
and	N
,	N
remarkably	N
,	N
about	N
two	N
months	N
later	N
,	N
this	N
young	N
man	N
and	N
his	N
mom	N
showed	N
up	N
,	N
and	N
he	N
looked	N
unbelievable	N
,	N
good	N
as	N
new	N
.	N
But	N
there	C
were	C
a	C
lot	C
of	C
families	C
who	C
did	C
n't	C
have	C
that	C
good	C
fortune	C
and	C
whose	C
sons	C
or	C
daughters	C
or	C
husbands	C
did	C
n't	C
survive	C
.	N
So	N
my	N
belief	N
is	N
that	N
,	N
(	N
A	N
)	N
,	N
we	C
have	C
to	C
enforce	C
the	C
laws	C
we	C
've	C
already	C
got	C
,	N
make	C
sure	C
that	C
we	C
're	C
keeping	C
guns	C
out	C
of	C
the	C
hands	C
of	C
criminals	C
,	N
those	P
who	P
are	P
mentally	P
ill	P
.	N
We	P
've	P
done	P
a	P
much	P
better	P
job	P
in	P
terms	P
of	P
background	P
checks	P
,	N
but	N
we	C
've	C
got	C
more	C
to	C
do	C
when	C
it	C
comes	C
to	C
enforcement	C
.	N
But	N
I	P
also	P
share	P
your	P
belief	P
that	P
weapons	P
that	P
were	P
designed	P
for	P
soldiers	P
in	P
war	P
theaters	P
do	P
n't	P
belong	P
on	P
our	P
streets	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
what	N
I	C
'm	C
trying	C
to	C
do	C
is	C
to	C
get	C
a	C
broader	C
conversation	C
about	C
how	C
do	C
we	C
reduce	C
the	C
violence	C
generally	C
.	N
Part	C
of	C
it	C
is	C
seeing	C
if	C
we	C
can	C
get	C
an	C
assault	C
weapons	C
ban	C
reintroduced	C
.	N
But	N
part	C
of	C
it	C
is	C
also	C
looking	C
at	C
other	C
sources	C
of	C
the	C
violence	C
.	N
Because	N
frankly	N
,	N
in	P
my	P
home	P
town	P
of	P
Chicago	P
,	P
there	P
's	P
an	P
awful	P
lot	P
of	P
violence	P
and	N
they	P
're	P
not	P
using	P
AK-47s	P
.	N
They	C
're	C
using	C
cheap	C
hand	C
guns	C
.	N
And	N
so	N
what	C
can	C
we	C
do	C
to	C
intervene	C
,	C
to	C
make	C
sure	C
that	C
young	C
people	C
have	C
opportunity	C
;	N
that	C
our	C
schools	C
are	C
working	C
;	N
that	C
if	C
there	C
's	C
violence	C
on	C
the	C
streets	C
,	C
that	C
working	C
with	C
faith	C
groups	C
and	C
law	C
enforcement	C
,	C
we	C
can	C
catch	C
it	C
before	C
it	C
gets	C
out	C
of	C
control	C
.	N
And	N
so	N
what	N
I	N
want	N
is	N
a	N
--	N
is	N
a	N
comprehensive	N
strategy	N
.	N
Part	P
of	P
it	P
is	P
seeing	P
if	P
we	P
can	P
get	P
automatic	P
weapons	P
that	P
kill	P
folks	P
in	P
amazing	P
numbers	P
out	P
of	P
the	P
hands	P
of	P
criminals	P
and	P
the	P
mentally	P
ill	P
.	N
But	N
part	P
of	P
it	P
is	P
also	P
going	P
deeper	P
and	P
seeing	P
if	P
we	P
can	P
get	P
into	P
these	P
communities	P
and	P
making	P
sure	P
we	P
catch	P
violent	P
impulses	P
before	P
they	P
occur	P

I	C

On	N
the	N
question	N
of	N
the	N
cost	N

our	N
budget	N
,	N
I	P
have	P
stated	P
that	P
it	P
's	P
my	P
best	P
judgment	P
that	P
our	P
agricultural	P
program	P
will	P
cost	P
a	P
billion	P

a	P
half	P

possibly	P
two	P
billion	P
dollars	P
less	P
than	P
the	P
present	P
agricultural	P
program	P

My	N
judgment	N
is	N
that	N
the	C
program	C
the	C
Vice	C

put	C
forward	C
,	N

an	N
extension	N
of	N
Mr	N

Benson	N
's	N
program	N
,	N
will	C
cost	C
a	C
billion	C
dollars	C
more	C
than	C
the	C
present	C
program	C
,	N
which	P
costs	P
about	P
six	P
billion	P
dollars	P
a	P
year	P
,	P
the	P
most	P
expensive	P
in	P
history	P
.	N
We	P
've	P
spent	P
more	P
money	P
on	P
agriculture	P
in	P
the	P
last	P
eight	P
years	P
than	P
the	P
hundred	P
years	P
of	P
the	P
Agricultural	P
Department	P
before	P
that	P
.	N
Secondly	N
,	N
I	C
believe	C
that	C
the	C
high	C
interest-rate	C
policy	C
that	C
this	C
Administration	C
has	C
followed	C
has	C
added	C
about	C
three	C
billion	C
dollars	C
a	C
year	C
to	C
interest	C
on	C
the	C
debt	C
-	N
merely	N
funding	N
the	N
debt	N
-	N
which	N
is	N
a	N
burden	N
an	N
the	N
taxpayers	N
.	N
I	P
would	P
hope	P
,	N
under	N
a	N
different	N
monetary	N
policy	N
,	N
that	P
it	P
would	P
be	P
possible	P
to	P
reduce	P
that	P
interest-rate	P
burden	N
,	N
at	P
least	P
a	P
billion	P
dollars	P
.	N
Third	N
,	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
possible	C
to	C
gain	C
a	C
seven	C
hundred	C
million	C
to	C
a	C
billion	C
dollars	C
through	C
tax	C
changes	C
which	N
I	C

close	C
up	C

loopholes	C
on	C
dividend	C
withholding	C
,	C
on	C
expense	C

.	N
Fourthly	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
suggested	N
that	N
the	P
medical	P
care	P
for	P
the	P
aged	P
-	P
and	P
the	P
bill	P
which	N
the	N
Congress	N
now	N
has	N
passed	N
and	N
the	N
President	N
signed	N
if	P
fully	P
implemented	P
would	P
cost	P
a	P
billion	P
dollars	P
on	P
the	P
Treasury	P
-	P
out	P
of	P
Treasury	P
funds	P
and	P
a	P
billion	P
dollars	P
by	P
the	P
states	P
-	N
the	P
proposal	P
that	P
I	P
have	P
put	P
forward	P
and	N
which	N
many	N
of	N
the	N
members	N
of	N
my	N
party	N
support	N
is	P
for	P
medical	P
care	P
financed	P
under	P
Social	P
Security	P
;	N
which	P
would	P
be	P
financed	P
under	P
the	P
Social	P
Security	P
taxes	P
;	N
which	P
is	P
less	P

when	P
they	P
retire	P
.	N
It	N
is	N
actuarially	N
sound	N
.	N
So	N
in	C
my	C
judgment	C
we	C
would	C
spend	C
more	C
money	C
in	C
this	C
Administration	C
on	C
aid	C

we	C
'd	C
spend	C
more	C
money	C

I	C
hope	C
more	C
wisely	C
on	C
defense	C
than	C
this	C
Administration	C
has	C
.	N
But	N
I	C
believe	C
that	C

work	C
for	C
a	C
balanced	C
budget	C

While	P

Georgia	P
,	P
although	P
I	P
'm	P
not	P
a	P
lawyer	P

we	P
had	P
complete	P
reform	P
of	P
the	P
Georgia	P
court	P
system	P

We	P
uh	P
-	P
streamlined	P
the	P
structure	P
of	P
the	P
court	P

put	P

administrative	P
officers	P

put	P
a	P
unified	P
court	P

required	P

all	P

uniformity	P

And	N
,	N
in	P
addition	P
to	P
that	P
put	P
forward	P
a	P
proposal	P
that	P
was	P
adopted	P
and	P
used	P
throughout	P
my	P
own	P
term	P
of	P
office	P
of	P
selection	P
of	P

for	P
all	P
judges	P

district	P
attorneys	P
or	P
prosecuting	P
attorneys	P
,	P
on	P
the	P
basis	P
of	P
merit	P

Every	P
time	P
I	P
had	P
a	P
vacancy	P
on	P
the	P
Georgia	P
Supreme	P
Court	P
-	P
and	P
I	P
filled	P
five	P
of	P
those	P
vacancies	P
out	P
of	P
seven	P
total	P
and	P
about	P
half	P
the	P
court	P
of	P
appeals	P
judges	P
,	P
about	P
35	P
percent	P
of	P
the	P
trial	P
judges	P
-	P
I	P
was	P
given	P
from	P
an	P
objective	P
panel	P
the	P
five	P
most	P
highly	P

And	N
from	P
those	P

I	P
always	P
chose	P
the	P
first	P
one	P
or	P
second	P
one	P
.	N
So	N
merit	C
selection	C
of	C
judges	C
is	C
the	C
most	C
important	C
single	C
criterion	C
.	N
And	N
I	C
would	C
institute	C
the	C

kind	C

not	C

in	C

but	C
also	C
in	C
diplomatic	C
appointments	C
.	N
Secondly	N
,	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
the	C
Burger	C
Court	C
has	C
fairly	C
well	C
confirmed	C
the	C
major	C
and	C
-	C
and	C
most	C
far-reaching	C
and	C
most	C
controversial	C
decisions	C

Civil	P

uh	P
has	P
been	P
confirmed	P
by	P
the	P

,	P
has	P
n't	P
been	P
uh	P
-	P
reversed	P
,	N
and	N
I	P
do	P
n't	P
think	P
there	P
's	P
any	P
inclination	P
to	P
reverse	P
those	P
basic	P
decisions	P
.	N
The	P
one-man	P
,	P
one-vote	P
rule	P
,	P
which	P
is	P
a	P
very	P
important	P
one	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
s-	P
struck	P
down	P
the	P
unwarranted	P
influence	P
in	P
the	P
legislature	P
of	P
parsley	P
-	P
uh	P

The	P
uh	P

right	P
of	P
indigent	P
or	P
very	P
poor	P
accused	P
persons	P
to	P
uh	P
-	P
legal	P
counsel	P
.	N
Uh	N
-	N
I	C
think	C
the	C
Burger	C
Court	C
has	C
confirmed	C
that	C
basic	C
and	C
very	C
controversial	C
decision	C
of	C
the	C
Warren	C
Court	C
.	N
Also	N
the	N
-	N
the	N
protection	N

an	N

person	N
against	N
unwarranted	N
persecution	N
in	N

get	N
a	N
false	N
uh	N
-	N
confession	N
.	N
But	N
now	N
I	N
think	N
there	N
have	N
been	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
instances	N
where	N
the	N
Burger	N
Court	N
has	N
made	N
technical	N
rulings	N
where	N
an	N
obviously	N
guilty	N
person	N
was	N
later	N
found	N
to	N
be	N
guilty	N
.	N
And	N
I	N
think	N
that	N
in	N
that	N
case	N
uh	N
-	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
more	N
liberal	N
uh	N
-	N
members	N
of	N
the	N
uh	N
-	N
so-called	N
Warren	N

agreed	N
with	N
those	N
decisions	N

But	N
the	N
only	N
uh	N
-	N
thing	N
I	N
uh	N
-	N
have	N
pointed	N
out	N
was	N
,	N
what	N
I	N
've	N
just	N
said	N

and	N
that	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
need	N

clarify	N
the	N
technicalities	N
so	N
that	N
you	N

n't	N
be	N
forced	N
to	N
release	N
a	N
person	N
who	N
was	N
obviously	N
guilty	N
just	N
because	N
of	N
a	N
-	N
of	N
a	N
small	N
technicality	N
in	N
the	N
law	N

And	N
-	N
and	N
that	N
's	N
a	N

uh	N

I	C

troubles	C
a	C

what	P

KENNEDY	N
:	N
Well	N
,	N
because	N
I	N
think	N
that	N
if	P
the	P
federal	P
government	P
moved	P
out	P
of	P
the	P
program	P
and	P
withdrew	P
its	P
supports	P
uh	N
-	N
then	N
I	C
think	C
you	C
would	C
have	C
complete	C
uh	C
-	C
economic	C
chaos	C
.	C
The	P
farmer	P
plants	P
in	P
the	P
spring	P
and	P
harvests	P
in	P
the	P
fall	P
.	P
There	P
are	P
hundreds	P
of	P
thousands	P
of	P
them	P
.	P
They	N
really	N
do	N
n't	N
-	N
they	P
're	P
not	P
able	P
to	P
control	P
their	P
market	P
very	P
well	P
.	P
They	P
bring	P
their	P
crops	P
in	P
or	P
their	P
livestock	P
in	P
,	P
many	P
of	P
them	P
about	P
the	P
same	P
time	P
.	P
They	P
have	P
only	P
a	P
few	P
purchasers	P
that	P
buy	P
their	P
milk	P
or	P
their	P
hogs	P
-	N
a	N
few	N
large	N
companies	N
in	N
many	N
cases	N
-	N
and	N
therefore	C
the	C
farmer	C
is	C
not	C
in	C
a	C
position	C
to	C
bargain	C
very	C
effectively	C
in	C
the	C
market	C
place	C
.	C
I	C
think	C
the	C
experience	C
of	C
the	C
twenties	C
has	C
shown	C
what	C
a	C
free	C
market	C
could	C
do	C
to	C
agriculture	C
.	C
And	N
if	P
the	P
agricultural	P
economy	P
collapses	P
,	P
then	N
the	C
economy	C
of	C
the	C
rest	C
of	C
the	C
United	C
States	C
sooner	C
or	C
later	C
will	C
collapse	C
.	C
The	P
farmers	P
are	P
the	P
number	P
one	P
market	P
for	P
the	P
automobile	P
industry	P
of	P
the	P
United	P
States	P
.	P
The	P
automobile	P
industry	P
is	P
the	P
number	P
one	P
market	P
for	P
steel	P
.	P
So	N
if	P
the	P
farmers	P
'	P
economy	P
continues	P
to	P
decline	P
as	P
sharply	P
as	P
it	P
has	P
in	P
recent	P
years	P
,	P
then	N
I	C
think	C
you	C
would	C
have	C
a	C
recession	C
in	C
the	C
rest	C
of	C
the	C
country	C
.	C
So	N
I	C
think	C
the	C
case	C
for	C
the	C
government	C
intervention	C
is	C
a	C
good	C
one	C
.	C
Secondly	N
,	N
my	N
objection	N
to	N
present	N
farm	N
policy	N
is	N
that	N
there	C
are	C
no	C
effective	C
controls	C
to	C
bring	C
supply	C
and	C
demand	C
into	C
better	C
balance	C
.	C
The	P
dropping	P
of	P
the	P
support	P
price	P
in	P
order	P
to	P
limit	P
production	P
does	P
not	P
work	P
,	P
and	N
we	P
now	P
have	P
the	P
highest	P
uh	P
-	P
surpluses	P
-	P
nine	P
billion	P
dollars	P
worth	P
.	P
We	P
've	P
had	P
a	P
uh	P
-	P
higher	P
tax	P
load	P
from	P
the	P
Treasury	P
for	P
the	P
farmer	P
in	P
the	P
last	P
few	P
years	P
with	P
the	P
lowest	P
farm	P
income	P
in	P
many	P
years	P
.	P
I	C
think	C
that	C
this	C
farm	C
policy	C
has	C
failed	C
.	C
In	C
my	C
judgment	C
the	C
only	C
policy	C
that	C
will	C
work	C
will	C
be	C
for	C
effective	C
supply	C
and	C
demand	C
to	C
be	C
in	C
balance	C
.	C
And	N
that	P
can	P
only	P
be	P
done	P
through	P
governmental	P
action	P
.	P
I	C
therefore	C
suggest	C
that	C
in	C
those	C
basic	C
commodities	C
which	C
are	C
supported	C
,	C
that	C
the	C
federal	C
government	C
,	C
after	C
endorsement	C
by	C
the	C
farmers	C
in	C
that	C
commodity	C
,	C
attempt	C
to	C
bring	C
supply	C
and	C
demand	C
into	C
balance	C
-	C
attempt	C
effective	C
production	C
controls	C
-	N
so	N
that	N
we	P
wo	P
n't	P
have	P
that	P
five	P
or	P
six	P
percent	P
surplus	P
which	P
breaks	P
the	P
price	P
fifteen	P
or	P
twenty	P
per	P
cent	P
.	P
I	C
think	C
Mr	C
.	C
Benson	C
's	C
program	C
has	C
failed	C
.	C
And	N
I	N
must	N
say	N

after	N
reading	N
the	N
Vice	N

the	N

I	C
do	C
n't	C

do	C

I	C
think	C
the	C

are	C
tied	C

Governor	N
Reagan	N
recently	N
mentioned	N
the	N
Reagan-Kemp-Roth	N
proposal	N
.	N
which	N
his	P
own	P
running	P
mate	P
,	P
George	P
Bush	P
,	P
described	P
as	P
voodoo	P
economics	P
,	P
and	P
said	P
that	P
it	P
would	P
result	P
in	P
a	P
30	P
%	P
inflation	P
rate	P
.	N
And	N
Business	P
Week	P
,	P
which	P
is	P
not	P
a	P
Democratic	P
publication	P
,	P
said	P
that	P
this	P
Reagan-Kemp-Roth	P
proposal	P
-	P
and	P
I	P
quote	P
them	P
,	P
I	P
think	P
-	P
was	P
completely	P
irresponsible	P
and	P
would	P
result	P
in	P
inflationary	P
pressures	P
which	P
would	P
destroy	P
this	P
nation	P
.	N
So	N
our	C
proposals	C
are	C
very	C
sound	C
and	N
very	C
carefully	C
considered	C
to	C
stimulate	C
jobs	C
,	N
to	C
improve	C
the	C
industrial	C
complex	C

this	C
country	C
,	N
to	C
create	C
tools	C
for	C
American	C
workers	C
,	N
and	N
at	C
the	C
same	C
time	C
would	C
be	C
anti-inflationary	C
in	C
nature	C
.	N
So	N
to	C
add	C
nine	C
million	C
new	C
jobs	C
,	C
to	C
control	C
inflation	C
,	C
and	C

the	C
future	C
with	C

Not	C
only	C
that	C
,	C
he	C
talks	C
about	C
Iran	C

The	C
reality	C
about	C
Iran	C
is	C
that	C
Iran	C
has	C
moved	C
forward	C
with	C
their	C
nuclear	C

the	N
sanctions	N

John	C
Kerry	C

I	C
believe	C
we	C
need	C
to	C
strengthen	C
the	C
sanctions	C

including	C

you	N
raised	N
it	N
in	N
this	N
question	N

This	C
is	C
relevant	C

because	N
he	P
was	P
pushing	P
for	P
lifting	P
sanctions	P
when	P
he	P
was	P
CEO	P
of	P
Halliburton	P
.	N
Here	N
's	N
why	N
we	C
did	C
n't	C
think	C
Halliburton	C
should	C
have	C
a	C
no-bid	C
contract	C
.	N
While	P
he	P
was	P
CEO	P
of	P
Halliburton	P
,	P
they	P
paid	P
millions	P
of	P
dollars	P
in	P
fines	P
for	P
providing	P
false	P
information	P
on	P
their	P
company	P
,	N
just	N
like	N
Enron	N

two	P

They	C
're	C
now	C

bribed	C
foreign	C
officials	C
during	C
that	C
period	C

Not	N
only	N
that	N

they	C

7.5	C

which	C
is	C
the	C

Well	N

this	N

It	N
's	N
been	N
a	N
very	N
tough	N
campaign	N

And	N
I	P
know	P
from	P
my	P
experience	P
in	P
many	P
campaigns	P
that	P
,	P
if	P
Senator	P

had	P
asked	P

responded	P
to	P
my	P
urgent	P
request	P
to	P
sit	P
down	P
,	P
and	P
do	P
town	P
hall	P
meetings	P
,	P
and	P
come	P
before	P
the	P
American	P
people	P
,	N
we	C
could	C
have	C
done	C
at	C
least	C
10	C
of	C
them	C
by	C
now	C
.	N
When	P
Senator	P
Obama	P
was	P
first	P
asked	P
,	P
he	P
said	P
,	P
``	P
Any	P
place	P
,	P
any	P
time	P
,	P
''	P
the	P
way	P
Barry	P
Goldwater	P

Jack	P

agreed	P

do	P
,	P
before	P
the	P
intervention	P
of	P
the	P
tragedy	P
at	P
Dallas	P
.	N
So	N
I	C
think	C
the	C
tone	C
of	C
this	C
campaign	C
could	C
have	C
been	C
very	C
different	C
.	N
And	N
the	N
fact	N
is	N
,	N
it	P
's	P
gotten	P
pretty	P
tough	P
.	N
And	N
I	C
regret	C
some	C
of	C
the	C
negative	C
aspects	C
of	C
both	C
campaigns	C
.	N
But	N
the	N
fact	N
is	N
that	N
it	C
has	C
taken	C
many	C
turns	C
which	C
I	C
think	C
are	C
unacceptable	C
.	N
One	P
of	P
them	P
happened	P
just	P
the	P
other	P
day	P
,	P
when	P
a	P
man	P
I	P
admire	P
and	P
respect	P
--	P
I	P
've	P
written	P
about	P
him	P
--	P
Congressman	P
John	P
Lewis	P
,	P
an	P
American	P
hero	P
,	P
made	P
allegations	P
that	P
Sarah	P
Palin	P

I	P
were	P
somehow	P
associated	P
with	P
the	P
worst	P
chapter	P
in	P
American	P
history	P
,	P
segregation	P
,	P
deaths	P
of	P
children	P
in	P
church	P
bombings	P
,	P
George	P
Wallace	P
.	N
That	P
,	P
to	P
me	P
,	P
was	P
so	P
hurtful	P
.	N
And	N
,	N
Senator	P
Obama	P
,	P
you	P
did	P
n't	P
repudiate	P
those	P
remarks	P
.	N
Every	P
time	P
there	P
's	P
been	P
an	P
out-of-bounds	P
remark	P
made	P
by	P
a	P
Republican	P
,	P
no	P
matter	P
where	P
they	P
are	P
,	P
I	P
have	P
repudiated	P
them	P

I	P
hope	P
that	P
Senator	P
Obama	P
will	P
repudiate	P
those	P
remarks	P
that	P
were	P
made	P
by	P
Congressman	P
John	P
Lewis	P
,	P
very	P
unfair	P
and	P
totally	P
inappropriate	P

So	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
tell	N
you	N

we	C
will	C
run	C
a	C
truthful	C

is	P
a	P
tough	P
campaign	P

And	N
it	N
's	N
a	N
matter	N

fact	N
that	N

I	P
strongly	P

if	P
we	P

do	P
that	P

do	P
it	P
in	P
a	P

gets	P
deeper	P

I	C

we	C
have	C
an	C
opportunity	C

long	C

begin	C
to	C
move	C
some	C
of	C
our	C
resources	C
from	C
the	C
military	C
to	C
important	C
domestic	C
priorities	C
that	N
can	N
provide	P
college	P
opportunity	P
for	P
that	P
young	P
woman	P
whose	P
mother	P
wrote	P
me	P
from	P
Texas	P
just	P
the	P
other	P

,	P
from	P
Longview	P
,	P
Texas	P
:	P
two	P
teachers	P
,	P
a	P
mother	P
and	P
a	P
father	P
who	P
have	P
a	P
child	P
that	P
's	P
a	P
freshman	P
in	P

an	P
electrical	P

a	P
very	P
bright	P

they	P
ca	P
n't	P
afford	P

So	N
I	P
hope	P
that	P
we	P
can	P
begin	P

move	P
those	P
resources	P

very	N

out	N
that	N
since	P

during	P

Republican	P

we	P
have	P

at	P
the	P

in	P

have	P
increased	P
the	P
minimum	P
tax	P
on	P
all	P

I	N
believe	N
that	N
by	P

in	N
some	N

I	C

probably	C
there	C
are	C
more	C
similarities	C

there	C

differences	C

our	C
personal	C
story	C
.	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
talk	N
about	N
myself	N
very	N
much	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
've	N
heard	N
Senator	N
Edwards	N
,	N
and	N
as	N
I	N
listen	N
to	N
him	N
,	N
I	N
find	N
some	N
similarities	N
.	N
I	P
come	P
from	P
relatively	P
modest	P
circumstances	P
.	N
My	P
grandfather	P
never	P
even	P
went	P
to	P
high	P
school	P
.	N
I	C
'm	C
the	C
first	C
in	C
my	C
family	C
to	C
graduate	C
from	C
college	C

I	P
carried	P
a	P
ticket	P
in	P
the	P
International	P

Electrical	P

have	C
some	C
idea	C
of	C
the	C
problems	C
that	C

encounter	C

I	C
think	C
the	C

are	C

in	C
some	C

surprisingly	C

respect	N
to	N
how	N
we	N

our	N

I	N
obviously	N
made	N
a	N
choice	N

I	N
've	N

good	N
long	N

for	N
those	N
periods	N

that	N
goes	N

the	N
turf	N

as	N
well	N
,	N
too	N

I	N
'm	N
absolutely	N
convinced	N
that	N
the	N
threat	N
we	N
face	N
now	N

the	C
idea	C

that	N
we	C
have	C
to	C
use	C
extraordinary	C
measures	C
to	C
deal	C
with	C
it	C

I	C
feel	C
very	C
strongly	C
that	C
the	C
significance	C
of	C
9/11	C
can	C
not	C
be	C

how	C

people	P

we	P
are	P

before	P
we	P
use	P

would	C
argue	C

already	C

lost	C
more	C

nothing	P

in	P

that	P

as	P
of	P

this	P

that	P

I	P
talked	P

But	N
,	N
I	C
think	C

going	C
back	C

the	C
time	C
when	C
the	C

I	C
worked	C
hard	C
for	C
it	C

it	C

we	C
simply	C

failed	C

pace	C
with	C
the	C
cost	C

today	P

the	P
average	P
serviceman	P
is	P
at	P

15	P
%	P
-	P
and	P
I	P
happen	P
to	P
think	P
that	P
's	P
a	P
very	P
modest	P
estimate	P

15	P

below	P
what	P

they	P

a	P
change	P
that	P

that	P
means	P

for	P
example	P
,	P
standing	P
up	P
for	P
human	P
rights	P

It	C
means	C
addressing	C
the	C

along	C
the	C

in	P

around	P
the	P

where	P
they	P

these	P

when	P
they	P
feel	P

it	P

OBAMA	N
:	N
Well	N
,	N
four	P
years	P
ago	P
,	P
when	P
I	P
was	P
running	P
for	P
office	P
,	P
I	P
was	P
traveling	P
around	P
and	P
having	P
those	P
same	P
conversations	P
that	P
Governor	P
Romney	P
talks	P
about	P
.	N
And	N
it	P
was	P
n't	P
just	P
that	P
small	P
businesses	P
were	P
seeing	P
costs	P
skyrocket	P
and	P
they	P
could	P
n't	P
get	P
affordable	P
coverage	P
even	P
if	P
they	P
wanted	P
to	P
provide	P
it	P
to	P
their	P
employees	P
.	N
It	P
was	P
n't	P
just	P
that	P
this	P
was	P
the	P
biggest	P
driver	P
of	P
our	P
federal	P
deficit	P
,	P
our	P
overall	P
health	P
care	P
costs	P
,	P
but	P
it	P
was	P
families	P
who	P
were	P
worried	P
about	P
going	P
bankrupt	P
if	P
they	P
got	P
sick	P
,	P
millions	P
of	P
families	P
,	P
all	P
across	P
the	P
country	P
.	N
If	P
they	P
had	P
a	P
pre-existing	P
condition	P
,	P
they	P
might	P
not	P
be	P
able	P
to	P
get	P
coverage	P
at	P
all	P
.	N
If	P
they	P
did	P
have	P
coverage	P
,	P
insurance	P
companies	P
might	P
impose	P
an	P
arbitrary	P
limit	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
as	P
a	P
consequence	P
,	P
they	P
're	P
paying	P
their	P
premiums	P
,	P
somebody	P
gets	P
really	P
sick	P
,	P
lo	P
and	P
behold	P
,	P
they	P
do	P
n't	P
have	P
enough	P
money	P
to	P
pay	P
the	P
bills	P
,	P
because	P
the	P
insurance	P
companies	P
say	P
that	P
they	P
've	P
hit	P
the	P
limit	P

So	N
we	C
did	C
work	C
on	C
this	C
,	C
alongside	C
working	C
on	C
jobs	C

because	N
this	P
is	P
part	P
of	P
making	P
sure	P
that	P
middle-class	P

are	P
secure	P
in	P
this	P

about	C

And	N
this	P

over	P
the	P
past	P
several	P

has	P
gutted	P
the	P

our	P

But	N
Fritz	C
Mondale	C

I	C
feel	C
very	C
strongly	C
that	C
if	C
you	C

that	C
that	C
's	C
an	C
effort	C

the	C

With	N
reference	N

I	N
think	N

at	N

both	N

we	C
both	C
have	C
extremely	C
strong	C
civil	C

This	C

It	P

Bob	P

It	P
came	P
in	P
in	P
the	P

on	P
the	P

As	N
a	N

of	N
fact	N
,	N
in	P
the	P
Congress	P
we	P
just	P
passed	P
overwhelmingly	P

With	N
regard	N
to	N
the	N
role	N

I	N
had	N
a	N
long	N

I	N
'm	N
sure	N
the	N

I	C
have	C
a	C
history	C
of	C
getting	C
things	C
done	C
in	C
the	C
United	C
States	C
Senate	C
.	N
John	P
McCain	P
would	P
acknowledge	P
that	P
.	N
My	P
record	P
shows	P
that	P
on	P
controversial	P
issues	P
.	N
I	C
would	C
be	C
the	C
point	C
person	C
for	C
the	C
legislative	C
initiatives	C
in	C
the	C
United	C

Congress	C
for	C
our	C

I	C
would	C
also	C
,	C
when	C
asked	C
if	C
I	C
wanted	C
a	C
portfolio	C
,	C
my	C
response	C
was	C
,	C
no	C

But	P
Barack	P
Obama	P
indicated	P
to	P
me	P
he	P
wanted	P
me	P
with	P
him	P
to	P
help	P
him	P
govern	P
.	N
So	C
every	C
major	C
decision	C
he	C
'll	C
be	C
making	C
,	C
I	C
'll	C
be	C
sitting	C

He	C
's	C

not	C
me	C

I	C
'll	C
give	C
my	C
best	C
advice	C

And	P
one	P
of	P
the	P
things	P
he	P
said	P
early	P
on	P
when	P
he	P
was	P
choosing	P
,	P
he	P
said	P
he	P
picked	P
someone	P
who	P
had	P
an	P
independent	P
judgment	P
and	P
would	P
n't	P
be	P
afraid	P
to	P
tell	P
him	P
if	P
he	P
disagreed	P

That	C
is	C
sort	C
of	C
my	C
reputation	C

So	C
I	C
look	C

I	C
also	C
understand	C
that	C
an	C

not	C
one	C

an	P

I	P

you	P

we	P
lost	P
a	P

I	P
was	P
over	P

I	P
got	P

come	P
home	P

went	P

the	P

beautiful	P

your	P

a	P
few	P

We	N
took	N
the	N

Thanks	P
to	P
the	P
miraculous	P
sacrifice	P

the	P

stayed	P

six	P

then	P
died	P

If	P
that	P

were	P
here	P

I	P
was	P
told	P
the	P

my	P
granddaughter	P

that	P

fifteen	P

or	P
maybe	P
for	P
the	P
rest	P
of	P
her	P
life	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
I	C
do	C
n't	C
think	C
that	C
you	C
make	C
an	C
exception	C
based	C
on	C
medical	C
knowledge	C
at	C
the	C
time	C

I	N
think	N
human	P
life	P
is	P
very	P
,	P
very	P
precious	P
.	N
And	N
,	N
look	N
,	N
this	N
has	N
n't	N
been	N
an	N
easy	N
decision	N
for	N
me	N
to	N
meet	N
.	N
I	N
know	N
others	N
disagree	N
with	N
it	N
.	N
But	N
when	P
I	P
was	P
in	P
that	P
little	P
church	P
across	P
the	P
river	P
from	P
Washington	P
and	P
saw	P
our	P
grandchild	P
christened	P
in	P
our	P
faith	P
,	P
I	P
was	P
very	P
pleased	P
indeed	P
that	P
the	P
mother	P
had	P
not	P
aborted	P
that	P
child	P
,	P
and	P
put	P
the	P
child	P
up	P
for	P
adoption	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
I	P
just	P
feel	P
this	P
is	P
where	P
I	P
'm	P
coming	P
from	P
.	N
And	N
it	N
is	N
personal	N
.	N
And	N
I	C
do	C
n't	C
assail	C
him	C
on	C
that	C
issue	C
,	C
or	C
others	C
on	C
that	C
issue	C
.	N
But	N
that	P
's	P
the	P
way	P
I	P
,	P
George	P

feel	P

everybody	P
now	P
knows	P
the	P
terrible	P
price	P
they	P
're	P
paying	P
by	P
waiting	P
until	P
it	P
's	P
obvious	P
to	P
the	P
brain-dead	P
that	P
they	P
have	P
problems	P

Now	P
,	P
hundreds	P

thousands	P

whole	P

Our	N

is	N
that	N

now	N

The	P
thing	P
that	P
I	P
am	P
in	P
this	P
race	P
for	P
is	P
to	P
tap	P
the	P
American	P
people	P
on	P
the	P
shoulder	P
and	P
to	P
say	P
to	P

fix	P

the	C

When	P

I	P
decided	P
we	P

stay	P

and	P
we	P
lived	P
with	P
that	P
problem	P
for	P
3	P

Now	N
let	N

we	N

the	N
White	N
House	N
as	N
far	N
as	N
federal	N
employees	N
are	N
concerned	N
The	P
first	P
order	P
that	P
I	P
issued	P
after	P
I	P
became	P
president	P
was	P
to	P
cut	P
or	P
eliminate	P
the	P
prospective	P
forty-thousand	P
increase	P
in	P
federal	P
employees	P
that	P
had	P
been	P
scheduled	P
by	P
my	P
predecessor	P
.	N
And	N
in	P
the	P
term	P
that	P
I	P
've	P
been	P
president	P
-	P
some	P
two	P
years	P
-	P
we	P
have	P
reduced	P
federal	P
employment	P
by	P
eleven	P
thousand	P
.	N
In	P
the	P
White	P
House	P
staff	P
itself	P
,	P
when	P
I	P
became	P
president	P
,	P
we	P
had	P
roughly	P
five	P
hundred	P
and	P
forty	P
employees	P
.	N
We	P
now	P
have	P
about	P
four	P
hundred	P
and	P
eighty-five	P
employees	P
,	N
so	N
we	C
've	C
made	C
a	C
rather	C
significant	C
reduction	C
in	C
the	C
number	C

on	C
the	C
White	C
House	C
staff	C
working	C
for	C
the	C

So	N
I	C
think	C
our	C
record	C
of	C
cutting	C
back	C
employees	C
,	C
plus	C
the	C
failure	C
on	C

the	C

10	P

the	P

there	C

when	C

do	C
carry	C
a	C

But	N
Columbine	P
spoke	P

a	P

It	C
's	C
really	C
a	C

It	C
's	C
a	C
culture	C
that	C
somewhere	C
along	C
the	C

we	C
've	C
begun	C
to	C
disrespect	C

Where	P
a	P

can	P
walk	P

have	P
their	P
heart	P
turned	P

a	P
result	P

decide	P
to	P
take	P
somebody	P

's	P
life	P
?	N
So	N
gun	C
laws	C
are	C
important	C
,	N
no	N
question	N
about	N
it	N
,	N

so	C
is	C
loving	C
children	C

character	C

faith-based	C

being	C
a	C
part	C

Some	P
desperate	P
child	P
needs	P
to	P
have	P
somebody	P
put	P
their	P
arm	P
around	P
them	P
and	P
say	P

we	P
love	P
you	P

So	N
there	N
's	N
a	N

this	C

I	N
know	N

feel	P

I	P
do	P
n't	P
mean	P
you	P

Mr	P

,	P
but	P
some	P
people	P
in	P
the	P
--	P
in	P
our	P
nation	P
feel	P
that	P
Pakistan	P
is	P
being	P
nice	P
to	P
us	P

and	P
that	P
we	P
should	P
walk	P
away	P

Pakistan	C
is	C
important	C
to	C
the	C
region	C
,	C
to	C
the	C
world	C
and	C
to	C
us	C
,	N
because	N
Pakistan	P
has	P
100	P
nuclear	P
warheads	P
and	P
they	P
're	P
rushing	P
to	P
build	P
a	P
lot	P
more	P

They	P
'll	P
have	P
more	P
than	P
Great	P

sometime	P
in	P
the	P
--	P
in	P
the	P
relatively	P
near	P

They	P
also	P
have	P
the	P
Haqqani	P
Network	P
and	P
the	P
Taliban	P
existent	P
within	P
their	P
country	P

And	N
so	N
a	C
Pakistan	C
that	C
falls	C
apart	C
,	C
becomes	C
a	C
failed	C
state	C

would	C
be	C
of	C
extraordinary	C
danger	C
to	C
Afghanistan	C

to	C
us	C

And	N
so	N
we	C
're	C
going	C

to	C
remain	C
helpful	C

rebuild	C
the	C

in	P

what	P
we	P

to	P
deal	P
with	P
our	P
long-term	P
deficits	P

but	P
to	P
do	P
that	P
,	P
let	P

look	P
where	P
some	P
of	P
the	P
money	P
's	P
going	P

$	P
716	P

we	P
were	P
able	P
to	P
save	P
from	P
the	P
Medicare	P
program	P
by	P
no	P
longer	P
overpaying	P

making	P
sure	P

were	P
n't	P
overpaying	P
providers	P
.	N
And	N
using	P
that	P
money	P
,	P
we	P
were	P
actually	P
able	P
to	P
lower	P
prescription	P
drug	P
costs	P
for	P
seniors	P
by	P
an	P
average	P
of	P

we	P
were	P
also	P
able	P
to	P
make	P
a	P

make	P
a	P
significant	P

save	P

through	P
the	P

throughout	P
the	P

So	N
the	C
way	C
for	C
us	C
to	C
deal	C

make	C
many	C

that	C

as	N
you	N
know	N

I	C
immediately	C
disbanded	C
it	C

It	C
was	C
perfectly	C
legal	C

you	N

you	N

I	C
still	C
believe	C

the	C
better	C
way	C

it	C

legal	C

the	C

would	C
push	C

that	C

reform	C
the	C

we	N

I	N

I	N
was	N

after	N
I	N

that	N

did	N
a	N

many	C

was	N
because	N
of	N
our	P
recruiting	P
effort	P

But	N
number	N
two	N
,	N
because	N
I	P
recognized	P
that	P
if	P
you	P

women	P

My	N
chief	N

for	N

absolutely	N

wanted	C

that	N

why	N
I	P
was	P

first	P
to	P
say	P
that	P
we	P
have	P
to	P
rebuild	P

Because	N
part	N

's	C
intentions	C
here	C
was	C
to	C
weaken	C
the	C

the	C
point	C
where	C
President	C

was	C

weakened	C

he	C
might	C
be	C

Two	N

to	C

foresight	C

some	C
of	C
these	C
problems	C

So	N
back	N
in	N
April	N

I	P
warned	P
the	P
administration	P

you	P

Russian	P
peacekeepers	P

Georgian	P
territory	P

That	N
made	N
no	N
sense	N
whatsoever	N

And	N
what	N
we	C
needed	C
to	C
do	C
was	C
replace	C
them	C
with	C
international	C
peacekeepers	C

a	C
special	C
envoy	C

it	C

it	C

possible	C
we	C
could	C
have	C
avoided	C
the	C

The	N
second	N
point	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
make	N

--	N
is	N
the	N
issue	N

Russia	C

feeling	C
powerful	C
because	N
of	N
petro-dollars	N

That	P
means	P

the	P
biggest	P
consumers	P

--	P
25	P
percent	P

the	P
world	P

--	P
have	P
to	P
have	P
an	P
energy	P
strategy	P
not	P
just	P
to	P
deal	P
with	P
Russia	P
,	N
but	N
to	C
deal	C
with	C
many	C
of	C
the	C
rogue	C
states	C
we	C
've	C
talked	C
about	C

Iran	C

Venezuela	C

And	N
that	N
means	N
,	N
yes	N
,	N
increasing	C
domestic	C
production	C
and	C
off-shore	C
drilling	C

we	P
only	P
have	P
3	P
percent	P

we	C
use	C
25	C

we	P
ca	P
n't	P
simply	P
drill	P

out	P

the	P

What	C
we	C
're	C

do	C

approach	C
it	C

you	N

first	P

he	P
was	P

it	P
going	P
around	P

We	C
need	C
the	C

out	P

The	P
history	P
in	P

that	P

a	P

there	P

And	N
what	N
I	N
have	N

because	N
the	P

have	P

we	C

stand	C

I	P
supported	P

was	P
a	P
well-structured	P

I	C
think	C
that	C
the	C
important	C
point	C

we	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
have	C
a	C
president	C
who	C
understands	C
the	C
benefits	C
of	C

also	C
is	C
going	C

unfair	C

the	N

we	N

n't	P

If	P

We	P

the	P
strongest	P

it	C

So	N
their	C

the	N
reason	N

Iran	P
is	P
a	P
state	P

for	C
them	C
to	C
be	C
able	C
to	C
provide	C
nuclear	C
technology	C
to	C
non-state	C
actors	C

that	C
's	C

they	P

they	P
want	P
to	P
see	P
Israel	P
wiped	P

the	P

that	P

can	C
take	C
the	C
diplomatic	C

it	P

we	P
went	P
in	P
at	P
their	P
request	P

the	P

out	P

we	P

if	N
you	N

there	P
were	P
the	P

they	P
began	P

meet	P

the	P

the	C

it	C

be	C
exorbitant	C

We	P
have	P
reduced	P
the	P

going	P

I	P
have	P
cut	P
defense	P
spending	P
.	N
And	N
the	N
reason	N
we	C
could	C
do	C
that	C
is	N
because	P
of	P
our	P
fantastic	P
success	P
in	P
winning	P
the	P
Cold	P
War	P

We	C
never	C
would	C
have	C
got	C
there	C
if	P
we	P
had	P
gone	P

listened	P
to	P
those	P
that	P
wanted	P
to	P
cut	P
defense	P
spending	P
.	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
is	C
important	C
that	C
the	C
US	C
stay	C
in	C
Europe	C
and	C
continue	C
to	C
guarantee	C
the	C

We	C
simply	C
can	C
not	C
pull	C
back	C
.	N
Now	N
,	N
when	P
anybody	P
has	P
a	P
spending	P
program	P
they	P
want	P
to	P
spend	P
money	P
on	P

,	P
they	P
say	P
,	P
well	P
,	P
let	P
's	P
cut	P
money	P
out	P
of	P
the	P
Defense	P
Dept	P

I	P
will	P
accept	P
and	P
have	P
accepted	P
the	P
recommendations	P
of	P

proven	P
leaders	P

Colin	P

They	P
feel	P
that	P

the	P
reductions	P
that	P
I	P
have	P
proposed	P
are	P
proper	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
I	C
simply	C
do	C
not	C
think	C
we	C
should	C
go	C
back	C
to	C
the	C

We	C

the	C

remaining	C

we	C
should	C
be	C
that	C

And	N
we	C
have	C
a	C
certain	C
disproportionate	C
responsibility	C

But	N
I	N
would	N
ask	N
the	N
American	N

understand	N
that	N
if	P
we	P
make	P
imprudent	P

go	P

risk	C
the	C

Also	N

there	N

about	N

In	P
California	P
,	P
sometime	P
ago	P
,	P
a	P
man	P
beat	P
a	P
woman	P
so	P
savagely	P
that	P
her	P

was	P
born	P
dead	P
with	P
a	P
fractured	P

and	N
the	P
California	P
State	P
Legislature	P
unanimously	P
passed	P
a	P
law	P
that	P
was	P
signed	P
by	P
the	P
then-Democratic	P
Governor	P
--	P
signed	P
a	P
law	P
that	P
said	P
that	P
any	P
man	P
who	P
so	P
abuses	P
a	P
pregnant	P

that	P
he	P
causes	P
the	P

unborn	P

shall	P
be	P
charged	P
with	P
murder	P
.	N
Now	N
,	N
is	C
n't	C
it	C
strange	C
that	C
that	C
same	C
woman	C
could	C
have	C
taken	C
the	C
life	C
of	C
her	C

child	C
,	N
and	N
it	C
was	C
abortion	C
and	C
not	C
murder	C

but	N
if	C
somebody	C
else	C
does	C
it	C
,	C
that	C

one	C
thing	C
sooner	C
or	C
later	C
we	C
're	C
going	C
to	C
have	C
to	C
consider	C
is	C
take	C
a	C
look	C
at	C
the	C
Social	C
Security	C
system	C

Because	N
we	P

got	P
a	P

You	C
have	C
to	C
be	C
very	C
careful	C

you	P

protect	P
the	P
people	P

are	P
already	P

the	P

something	P
you	P

consider	P

I	N
'm	N
not	N
suggesting	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
done	N

but	N
at	N

we	N
ought	N
to	N
look	N
at	N
it	N
.	N
It	N
's	N
been	N
looked	N
,	N
When	P
I	P
was	P
chairman	P
of	P
the	P
finance	P
committee	P
which	P
handled	P
Social	P
Security	P
we	P
looked	P
at	P
all	P
these	P
options	P

and	N
one	N
thing	N
we	N
've	N
got	N
to	N
make	N
certain	N
,	N
when	P
I	P
used	P
to	P
go	P
home	P
my	P
mother	P
would	P
tell	P
me	P
all	P
I	P
've	P
got	P
is	P
my	P
Social	P
Security	P
,	P
do	P
n't	P
touch	P
it	P
.	N
And	N
we	P
did	P
n't	P
touch	P
it	P
.	N
We	P
preserved	P
it	P
.	N
And	N
I	C
'm	C
an	C
optimist	C
.	N
Your	N
your	C
Social	C
Security	C
is	C
going	C
to	C
be	C
there	C
when	C
you	C
retire	C
.	N
We	C
will	C
fix	C
it	C
.	N
It	C
will	C
probably	C
happen	C
in	C
the	C
year	C
2012	C
or	C
2015	C
.	N
In	P
1983	P
we	P
thought	P
we	P
had	P
a	P
75	P
-year	P
fix	P
.	N
It	P
did	P
n't	P
work	P
.	N
Much	N
,	N
much	N
less	N
,	N
but	N
at	P
least	P
we	P
fixed	P
it	P
for	P
some	P
time	P
and	P
37	P
to	P
40	P
million	P
people	P
get	P
their	P
checks	P
on	P
time	P
.	N
So	N
we	C
need	C
to	C
preserve	C
the	C
system	C
.	N
And	N
we	C
need	C
to	C
make	C
it	C
stronger	C
.	N
But	N
we	C
also	C
need	C
to	C
look	C
at	C
some	C
options	C
,	C
whether	C
or	C
not	C
we	C
--	C
depending	C
on	C
what	C
the	C
options	C
are	C

In	N
fact	N
,	N
they	P
have	P
got	P
a	P
commission	P
right	P
now	P
in	P

a	P

oversight	P

We	N

he	P

that	P
you	P

treat	P
the	P
taxpayers	P

this	P
case	P

And	N
,	N
lastly	N
,	N
what	P
you	P
have	P
to	P
do	P

make	P

a	N
consequence	N

it	C

it	C

that	C
somebody	C

There	C

the	P
voices	P

stop	P
sending	P
us	P

Not	C
because	C
we	C
coddled	C

the	C

recently	P

lower	P
some	P
barriers	P

they	P
ought	P

third	N
thing	N

one	N
of	N
the	N
things	N
I	N

we	C
have	C
to	C
do	C

make	C

I	N
also	N
think	N
that	N
we	C
're	C
going	C

have	C
to	C
rebuild	C
our	C
infrastructure	C

which	C
is	C
falling	C
behind	C

our	C
roads	C

our	C
bridges	C

also	C
broadband	C
lines	C
that	C
reach	C
into	C
rural	C
communities	C

,	N
making	C

that	C
we	C
have	C

the	C
alternative	C
energy	C

that	C
are	C
using	C
them	C

So	N
there	N
are	N
some	N
--	N
some	N
things	N
that	N
we	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
do	C
structurally	C
to	C
make	C
sure	C
that	C
we	C

CLINTON	N
:	N
I	N
'd	N
like	N
to	N
answer	N
the	N
question	N
,	N
because	N
I	P
've	P
actually	P
been	P
a	P
governor	P
for	P
12	P
years	P
,	N
so	N
I	P
've	P
known	P
a	P
lot	P
of	P
people	P

have	P
lost	P
their	P

people	P
whose	P
plants	P
have	P
been	P
strengthened	P
by	P
increasing	P
exports	P
.	N
The	C
trick	C
is	C
to	C
expand	C
our	C
export	C
base	C
and	C
to	C
expand	C
trade	C
on	C
terms	C
that	C
are	C
fair	C
to	C

It	P

true	P
that	P
our	P
exports	P
to	P
Mexico	P

for	P

have	P
gone	P
up	P

our	P
trade	P

has	P
gone	P
down	P

it	P

was	P
announced	P

what	N

the	N
answer	N

Let	N
me	N
just	N
mention	N
three	N
things	N
very	N
quickly	N

have	C
measures	C
on	C
the	C
books	C
that	C
do	C
n't	C
take	C
forever	C
and	C
a	C
day	C
to	C
implement	C
.	N
Number	N
two	N
,	N
change	C
the	C
tax	C
code	C

There	P
are	P
more	P

the	P
tax	P
code	P
for	P
shutting	P
plants	P
down	P

moving	P
overseas	P
than	P
there	P
are	P
for	P
modernizing	P
plant	P
and	P
equipment	P
here	P

Our	P
competitors	P
do	P
n't	P
do	P
that	P

Emphasize	P
and	P
subsidize	P
modernizing	P
plant	P
and	P
equipment	P
here	P
,	P
not	P
moving	P
plants	P
overseas	P
.	N
Number	N
three	N
,	N
stop	C
the	C
federal	C
government	C

program	C
that	C
now	C

Right	C
now	C
all	C
the	C

We	C
need	C

that	N
's	N
going	N

require	N
more	N

on	N
the	N

I	C
also	C
believe	C

one	C
of	C
the	C

do	C
it	C

we	C
're	C
overextended	C

Ask	N
the	N
people	N
in	N
the	N
armed	N
forces	N
today	N
.	N
We	P
've	P
got	P

are	P
doing	P

We	C
've	C
got	C
a	C
backdoor	C

in	C
America	C
today	C

people	P
with	P
stop-loss	P

they	P
're	P

n't	P

out	P

this	C
is	C
the	C
way	C
the	C

overextended	C

also	C
intend	C

double	C

that	N

we	N

that	N
the	P

Jim	N

I	C
hope	C
that	C
we	C
can	C
come	C
back	C
to	C
the	C
subject	C
of	C
education	C
because	N
the	P
governor	P
made	P
an	P
extensive	P
statement	P
on	P
it	P
and	P
I	P
have	P
a	P
very	P
different	P
view	P
than	P
the	P
one	P
he	P
expressed	P
.	N
But	N
that	N
having	N
been	N
said	N
,	N
I	N
believe	N
that	N
--	N
well	N
,	N
first	N
of	N
all	N
,	N
let	N
me	N
say	N
that	N
the	N
governor	N
and	N
I	N
agree	N
on	N
some	N
things	N
where	N
this	N
subject	N
is	N
concerned	N
.	N
I	C
will	C
not	C
do	C
anything	C
to	C
affect	C
the	C
rights	C
of	C
hunters	C
or	C
sportsmen	C
.	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
homeowners	C
have	C
to	C
be	C
respected	C
and	C
their	C
right	C
to	C
have	C
a	C
gun	C
if	C
they	C
wish	C
to	C
.	N
The	P
problem	P
I	P
see	P
is	P
that	P
there	P
are	P
too	P
many	P
guns	P
getting	P
into	P
the	P
hands	P
of	P
children	P
,	P
and	P
criminals	P
,	N
and	N
people	C
who	C
,	C
for	C
whatever	C
reason	C
,	C
some	C
kind	C
of	C
history	C
of	C
stalking	C
or	C
domestic	C
abuse	C
really	C
should	C
not	C
be	C
able	C
to	C
get	C
guns	C
.	N
I	C
think	C
these	C
assault	C
weapons	C
are	C
a	C
problem	C
.	N
So	N
I	C
favor	C
closing	C
the	C

In	N
fact	N

I	P
cast	P
the	P
tie-breaking	P

close	P
it	P
,	P
but	P
then	P
the	P
majority	P
in	P
the	P
House	P
of	P

went	P
the	P
other	P
way	P
.	N
That	P
's	P
still	P
pending	P

If	P
we	P
could	P
get	P
agreement	P
on	P
that	P
,	P
maybe	P
they	P
could	P
pass	P
that	P
in	P
the	P

I	C
think	C
we	C
should	C
toughen	C
the	C
enforcement	C
of	C

so	P
that	P
the	P

an	P
excessive	P

One	P
of	P
the	P

made	P
was	P
to	P
deregulate	P
the	P
major	P

this	P

We	C
've	C
been	C
remarkably	C
successful	C

with	C
the	C
help	C
of	C
a	C
Democratic	C

We	P
have	P
deregulated	P
the	P

In	N
addition	N
to	N
that	N

I	C
believe	C
that	C
this	C
element	C
of	C

is	C
something	C
that	C
the	C
South	C
has	C
seen	C
so	C
vividly	C
as	C
a	C
blight	C
on	C
our	C
region	C
of	C
the	C
country	C
which	C
has	C
now	C
been	C
corrected	C
-	C
not	C
only	C
racial	C
discrimination	C
but	C
discrimination	C
against	C
people	C
that	C
have	C
to	C
work	C
for	C
a	C
living	C
-	N
because	N
we	P
have	P
been	P
trying	P
to	P
pick	P
ourselves	P
up	P
by	P
our	P
bootstraps	P
,	P
since	P
the	P
long	P
depression	P

lead	P

We	C
have	C
made	C
remarkable	C

It	C
is	C

consciousness	C

of	C
my	C

my	P
heritage	P

a	P
Southerner	P

my	P
experience	P
in	P
