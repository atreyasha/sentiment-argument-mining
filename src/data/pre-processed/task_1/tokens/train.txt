Now	N

we	P
've	P
made	P
it	P
clear	P

along	P

our	P

that	P
when	P
Milosevic	P
leaves	P

then	P
Serbia	P
will	P
be	P
able	P
to	P
have	P
a	P
more	P
normal	P
relationship	P

rest	P

That	C
is	C
a	C
very	C

we	C

Bear	N
in	N
mind	N
also	N
,	N
Milosevic	P
has	P
been	P
indicted	P
as	P
a	P
war	P
criminal	P
and	N
he	C
should	C
be	C
held	C
accountable	C
for	C
his	C
actions	C
.	N
Now	N
,	N
we	C
have	C
to	C
take	C
measured	C
steps	C
because	N
the	C
sentiment	C
within	C

is	C

for	C
understandable	C

the	P
whole	P

this	P
up	P
that	P
they	P
placed	P

they	P
thought	P

a	P
greater	P
reliance	P

it	C

do	C
stand	C
with	C

But	N
the	N
reason	N
for	N
that	N
is	N
obvious	N

They	P
start	P
from	P
a	P
much	P
lower	P
base	P

Although	N
they	N
have	N
been	N
moving	N

we	N
have	N

we	N
find	N

for	N
example	N
,	N
today	P
that	P
their	P
total	P
gross	P

only	P
forty-four	P

the	P

twenty	P

And	N
as	N
far	N
as	N
the	N
absolute	N
gap	N

we	C
find	C
that	C

even	C
further	C

that	C

Our	P
health	P
program	P

the	P
one	P
that	P
Senator	P
Javits	P

other	P
Republican	P
Senators	P
,	P
as	P
well	P
as	P
I	P
supported	P
-	P
is	P
one	P
that	P
provides	P
for	P
all	P

over	P
sixty-five	P
who	P
want	P
health	P

either	P

understand	C
better	C
when	C

look	C
at	C
what	C
happened	C
when	C

during	C

the	C

over	C
a	C
lifetime	C
eaten	C
up	C
by	C
inflation	C

We	P
found	P
the	P
people	P
who	P
could	P
least	P
afford	P
it	P

people	P
on	P
retired	P

their	P

at	P
the	P
end	P
of	P
the	P

It	P
is	P
essential	P
that	P
a	P
man	P
who	P
's	P
president	P

it	P

NIXON	N
:	N
Our	N

are	N
very	N
different	N

I	C
think	C
that	C
Senator	C
Kennedy	C
's	C
policies	C
and	C
recommendations	C
for	C
the	C
handling	C
of	C
the	C
Castro	C
regime	C
are	C
probably	C
the	C
most	C
dangers-	C
dangerously	C
irresponsible	C
recommendations	C
that	C
he	C
's	C
made	C
during	C
the	C
course	C
of	C
this	C
campaign	C
.	N
In	P
effect	P
,	P
what	P
Senator	P
Kennedy	P
recommends	P
is	P
that	P
the	P
United	P
States	P
government	P
should	P
give	P
help	P
to	P
the	P
exiles	P
and	P
to	P
those	P
within	P
Cuba	P
who	P
oppose	P
the	P
Castro	P
regime	P
-	P
provided	P
they	P
are	P
anti-Batista	P
.	N
Now	P
let	P
's	P
just	P
see	P
what	P
this	P
means	P
.	N
We	P
have	P
five	P
treaties	P
with	P
Latin	P
America	P
,	P
including	P
the	P
one	P
setting	P
up	P
the	P
Organization	P
of	P
American	P
States	P
in	P
Bogota	P
in	P
1948	P
,	P
in	P
which	P
we	P
have	P
agreed	P
not	P
to	P
intervene	P
in	P
the	P
internal	P
affairs	P
of	P
any	P
other	P
American	P
country	P
-	P
and	P
they	P
as	P
well	P
have	P
agreed	P
to	P
do	P
likewise	P
.	N
The	P
charter	P
of	P
the	P
United	P
Nations	P
-	P
its	P
Preamble	P
,	P
Article	P
I	P
and	P
Article	P
II	P
-	P
also	P
provide	P
that	P
there	P
shall	P
be	P
no	P
intervention	P
by	P
one	P
nation	P
in	P
the	P
internal	P
affairs	P
of	P
another	P
.	N
Now	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
know	N
what	N
Senator	N
Kennedy	N
suggests	N
when	N
he	N
says	N
that	N
we	N
should	N
help	N
those	N
who	N
oppose	N
the	N
Castro	N
regime	N
,	N
both	N
in	N
Cuba	N
and	N
without	N
.	N
But	N
I	N
do	N
know	N
this	N
:	N
that	N
if	C
we	C
were	C
to	C
follow	C
that	C
recommendation	C
,	C
that	C
we	C
would	C
lose	C
all	C
of	C
our	C
friends	C
in	C
Latin	C
America	C
,	C
we	C
would	C
probably	C
be	C
condemned	C
in	C
the	C
United	C
Nations	C
,	C
and	C
we	C
would	C
not	C
accomplish	C
our	C
objective	C
.	N
I	N
know	N
something	N
else	N

It	C
would	C
be	C
an	C
open	C
invitation	C
for	C
Mr	C

to	C
come	C
in	C

to	C
come	C
into	C
Latin	C
America	C
and	C
to	C
engage	C
us	C
in	C
what	C
would	C
be	C
a	C
civil	C
war	C
,	C
and	C
possibly	C
even	C
worse	C
than	C
that	C
.	N
This	P
is	P
the	P
major	P
recommendation	P
that	P
he	P
's	P
made	P
.	N
Now	N
,	N
what	N
can	N
we	N
do	N
?	N
Well	N
,	N
we	C
can	C
do	C
what	C
we	C
did	C
with	C
Guatemala	C
.	N
There	P
was	P
a	P
Communist	P
dictator	P
that	P
we	P
inherited	P
from	P
the	P
previous	P
Administration	P
.	N
We	P
quarantined	P
Mr	P
.	P
Arbenz	P
.	N
The	P
result	P
was	P
that	P
the	P
Guatemalan	P
people	P
themselves	P
eventually	P
rose	P
up	P
and	P
they	P
threw	P
him	P
out	P

We	P
are	P
quarantining	P
Mr	P

Castro	P
today	P

We	P
're	P
quarantining	P
him	P
diplomatically	P
by	P
bringing	P
back	P

Ambassador	P

economically	P
by	P
cutting	P
off	P

Senator	C

's	C
suggestion	C
that	C
the	C
trade	C
that	C
we	C
cut	C

is	C
not	C
significant	C
is	C
just	C
one	C

We	P
are	P
cutting	P
off	P
the	P
significant	P
items	P
that	P
the	P
Cuban	P
regime	P
needs	P
in	P

to	P
survive	P

By	C
cutting	C

by	C
cutting	C
off	C
our	C
diplomatic	C
relations	C
as	C
we	C
have	C
,	C
we	C
will	C
quarantine	C
this	C

that	C
the	C
people	C

for	C

Al	P

And	N
the	C
first	C
way	C
we	C

we	C

everything	C
we	C
can	C
using	C
governmental	C
support	C

such	N
as	N
the	N
Small	N

I	C
think	C

come	C

So	N
bottom	N
line	N
,	N
this	P
is	P
an	P
unfair	P

unacceptable	P
situation	P

even	P
though	P

the	P

that	P
will	P

five	P

The	P
President	P
held	P
it	P
up	P

even	P
when	P
it	P
finally	P
got	P
near	P
passage	P
,	P
Senator	P
Kennedy	P
held	P
it	P
up	P
for	P
100	P
days	P
,	P
because	P
he	P
was	P
n't	P
satisfied	P
with	P
one	P

it	P
will	P
cover	P

you	P

there	C
are	C
a	C

good	C
things	C

then	N

what	C

that	C

's	C
prepared	C

for	C

It	C
's	C

I	C

This	C
is	C
a	C
very	C

very	C
difficult	C

fundamental	C
decision	C
that	C
all	C

us	C

make	C

And	N
what	P
he	P
is	P
saying	P

if	P

him	P
correctly	P

that	N

we	N
have	N
just	N
heard	N
two	N

from	N
the	N
vice	N

he	C
's	C
not	C
going	C

I	N
repeat	N
,	N
within	P
days	P
after	P
you	P

you	P
broke	P
it	P

you	P
said	P
,	P
well	P

maybe	P
as	P
a	P
last	P

we	P
'll	P

you	P

that	C

home	N

and	N
we	N
just	N
talked	N
about	N
the	N
fact	N
that	N
our	N
budget	N
is	N
way	N
overstretched	N

we	N

we	C

And	N
we	C

Why	N

Because	N
the	P

What	C

we	C

it	P

re-invent	P

not	P
just	P

the	P

so	N
our	N
America	N

It	P
says	P

The	C

that	C

trying	C
where	C
you	C
control	C
everything	C

The	N
governors	N

Governor	N

maybe	N
--	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
want	N

But	N
they	P
come	P
to	P
me	P
and	P
they	P
say	P
,	P
please	P
get	P
the	P
Congress	P
to	P
stop	P
passing	P
so	P
many	P
mandates	P
telling	P
us	P
how	P
to	P
control	P

We	P
know	P

it	P

wherever	P
it	P

this	P
is	P
what	P
our	P

all	P
about	P

And	N
I	N

you	N

reading	N
a	N

uh	N
-	N
a	N
-	N
a	N
particular	N
discussion	N
that	N

n't	N
have	N
occurred	N
right	N
at	N
that	N
time	N

the	N
indication	N

how	N
would	N
Mr	N

if	N
we	N

the	N
answer	N

that	N

There	P
is	P
a	P
considerable	P
anti-Washington	P
feeling	P
throughout	P
the	P

But	N
I	C
think	C
the	C
feeling	C
is	C
misplaced	C

In	P
the	P
last	P
two	P

we	P
have	P
restored	P
integrity	P

we	P
've	P
set	P
high	P
standards	P
in	P
the	P
executive	P
branch	P
of	P
the	P

.	N
The	C
anti-Washington	C
feeling	C
,	C
in	C
my	C
opinion	C
,	C
ought	C
to	C
be	C
focused	C
on	C
the	C
Congress	C
of	C
the	C
United	C

.	N
For	P
example	P
,	P
this	P
Congress	P
,	P
very	P
shortly	P
,	P
will	P
spend	P
a	P
billion	P
dollars	P
a	P
year	P
for	P
its	P
housekeeping	P
,	P
its	P

its	P
expenses	P

the	P
like	P

It	N
-	N
the	P
next	P
Congress	P
will	P
probably	P
be	P
the	P
first	P
billion-dollar	P
Congress	P
in	P
the	P
history	P
of	P
the	P
United	P

.	N
I	C
do	C
n't	C
think	C
the	C
American	C
people	C
are	C
getting	C
their	C
money	C
's	C
worth	C
from	C
the	C
majority	C
party	C
that	C
run	C
this	C
Congress	C

We	P
,	P
in	P
addition	P
,	P
see	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
in	P
the	P
last	P
uh	P
-	P
four	P
years	P
the	P
number	P
of	P
employees	P
hired	P
by	P
the	P
Congress	P
has	P
gone	P
up	P
substantial-	P
uh	P
much	P
more	P
than	P
uh	P
-	P
the	P
gross	P
national	P

,	P
much	P
more	P
than	P
any	P
other	P
increase	P
throughout	P

Congress	P
is	P
hiring	P
people	P
by	P
the	P
droves	P
,	P
and	P
the	P
cast	P

a	P
result	P

gone	P
up	P

I	C

any	C
improvement	C

the	C

it	C

the	C

at	C
everybody	C
in	C

it	C

where	C
the	C

which	C
is	C
the	C
Congress	C

and	C
particularly	C
the	C
majority	C

some	P

seems	N
to	N
me	N
that	N
in	C
this	C

the	C

should	C
not	C
be	C
on	C

the	C

One	P
of	P
the	P
reasons	P
we	P
have	P
an	P

that	P
we	P

of	P
the	P

you	N

Bob	N

I	N
think	N
everybody	N
understands	N
at	N
this	N
point	N
that	N
we	P
are	P
experiencing	P
the	P
worst	P
financial	P
crisis	P
since	P
the	P
Great	P
Depression	P
.	N
And	N
the	C
financial	C
rescue	C
plan	C
that	C
Senator	C
McCain	C
and	C
I	C
supported	C
is	C
an	C
important	C
first	C
step	C
.	N
And	N
I	C
pushed	C
for	C
some	C
core	C
principles	C
:	C
making	C
sure	C
that	C
taxpayer	C
can	C
get	C
their	C
money	C
back	C
if	C
they	C
're	C
putting	C
money	C
up	C
.	N
Making	C
sure	C
that	C
CEOs	C
are	C
not	C
enriching	C
themselves	C
through	C
this	C
process	C
.	N
And	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
it	C
's	C
going	C
to	C
take	C
some	C
time	C
to	C
work	C
itself	C
out	C
.	N
But	N
what	C
we	C
have	C
n't	C
yet	C
seen	C
is	C
a	C
rescue	C
package	C
for	C
the	C
middle	C
class	C
.	N
Because	N
the	P
fundamentals	P
of	P
the	P
economy	P
were	P
weak	P
even	P
before	P
this	P
latest	P
crisis	P
.	N
So	N
I	N
've	N
proposed	N
four	N
specific	N
things	N
that	N
I	N
think	N
can	N
help	N

Number	N
one	N

let	C
's	C
focus	C
on	C

I	C
want	C
to	C
end	C
the	C
tax	C
breaks	C
for	C
companies	C
that	C
are	C
shipping	C
jobs	C
overseas	C
and	C
provide	C
a	C
tax	C
credit	C
for	C
every	C
company	C
that	C
's	C
creating	C
a	C
job	C
right	C
here	C
in	C
America	C
.	N
Number	N
two	N
,	N
let	C
's	C
help	C
families	C
right	C
away	C
by	C
providing	C
them	C
a	C
tax	C

--	C
a	C
middle-class	C
tax	C
cut	C
for	C
people	C
making	C
less	C
than	C
$	C
200,000	C
,	N
and	N
let	C
's	C
allow	C
them	C

access	C

accounts	C
without	C
penalty	C
if	C
they	C
're	C
experiencing	C
a	C
crisis	C
.	N
Now	N
Senator	N
McCain	N
and	N
I	P
agree	P
with	P
your	P
idea	P
that	P
we	P

homeowners	P

's	N

they	C

I	C
disagree	C
with	C
Senator	C
McCain	C
in	C
how	C
to	C
do	C
it	C
,	N
because	N
the	P
way	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
has	P
designed	P
his	P
plan	P
,	P
it	P
could	P
be	P
a	P
giveaway	P
to	P
banks	P
if	P
we	P
're	P
buying	P
full	P

for	P
mortgages	P
that	P
now	P
are	P
worth	P
a	P

less	P

And	N
we	P
do	P
n't	P
want	P
to	P
waste	P
taxpayer	P
money	P

And	N
we	C

the	N

we	C

this	C

we	C
have	C
to	C
realize	C
where	C
it	C
is	C
.	N
In	C
analyzing	C
the	C
figures	C
we	C
will	C
find	C
that	C
our	C
unemployment	C
exists	C
among	C
the	C

it	C

It	C
also	C

If	C
we	C
're	C

we	C

not	C

're	C
going	C

a	C

I	C
believe	C
this	C
economy	C
is	C
sound	C
and	C
that	C
we	C
're	C
going	C
to	C
move	C
up	C

But	N
second	N
,	N
in	N

to	N
that	N
,	N
if	C
we	C
do	C
get	C
into	C
a	C
recessionary	C
period	C
we	C
should	C
move	C
on	C
that	C
part	C

the	C
economy	C
which	C
is	C
represented	C

I	C

stimulate	C
that	C

the	C
economy	C
that	C
can	C
create	C
jobs	C
-	N
the	N
private	N
sector	N
of	N
the	N
economy	N

This	C
means	C
through	C
tax	C
reform	C
and	C
if	C
necessary	C
tax	C
cuts	C
that	C
will	C
stimulate	C
more	C
jobs	C

I	C
favor	C
that	C
rather	C
than	C
massive	C
federal	C

which	C

long	C
after	C
you	C
've	C
passed	C
through	C
the	C

So	N
we	C

all	C

these	C

the	C
purpose	C

there	C

over	P
a	P
million	P

But	N
we	C
think	C
the	C
key	C
is	C
to	C
address	C
some	C
basic	C

fundamental	C
issues	C
that	C
the	C
president	C
's	C
already	C

probably	C
the	C
most	C
successful	C
thing	C
we	C
can	C
do	C
with	C
respect	C

to	C

There	C
's	C
no	C
better	C
antidote	C
to	C
poverty	C
than	C
a	C
good	C

well-paying	C
job	C
that	C
allows	C

a	P
product	P

the	P
president	P

his	P

the	P
No	P

it	N

several	N

the	P
Massachusetts	P

the	P
only	P

I	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
tough	C

when	P
a	P
narcotics	P

I	C
think	C
they	C

pay	C

And	N
I	C
do	C
believe	C
it	C

be	C

And	N
so	N
I	C
am	C
not	C
going	C
to	C
furlough	C
men	C
like	C
Willie	C

and	N
I	C
would	C
meet	C
with	C
their	C
,	C
the	C
victims	C
of	C
his	C
last	C
escapade	C
,	C
the	C
rape	C

the	C
brutalization	C
of	C
the	C
family	C
down	C
there	C
in	C
Maryland	C
.	N
Maryland	C
would	C
not	C
extradite	C
Willie	C
Horton	C
,	N
the	P
man	P
who	P
was	P
furloughed	P
,	P
the	P
murderer	P

n't	P
want	P

In	P

we	P

a	N
little	N

what	P
I	P
've	P

your	P

250,000.00	P

no	P

that	P
means	P
98	P

of	P
American	P
families	P
,	P
97	P
percent	P

I	C
'm	C
ready	C
to	C
sign	C
that	C

right	C
now	C
.	N
The	C
only	C
reason	C
it	C
's	C
not	C
happening	C
is	N
because	N
Governor	P

's	P
allies	P
in	P

have	P
held	P
the	P
98	P

they	P
want	P
tax	P
breaks	P
for	P
the	P
top	P
2	P
percent	P
.	N
But	N
what	N
I	N
've	N
also	N
says	N
is	N
for	N
above	N
$	N
250,000	N
,	N
we	N
can	N
go	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
tax	N
rates	N
we	N
had	N
when	N
Bill	N
Clinton	N
was	N
president	N
.	N
We	C
created	C
23	C
million	C
new	C
jobs	C

That	N
's	N
part	N
of	N
what	N
took	N
us	N
from	N
deficits	N
to	N

It	C
will	C
be	C
good	C

it	C
will	C
be	C
good	C
for	C

.	N
Now	N
,	N
Governor	N
Romney	N
has	N
a	N
different	N
philosophy	N
.	N
He	N
was	N
on	N
60	N
Minutes	N
just	N
two	N
weeks	N
ago	N
and	N
he	N
was	N
asked	N

Is	P
it	P
fair	P
for	P
somebody	P

you	P

making	P

20	P

a	P

pay	P
a	P

than	P
a	P
nurse	P

a	P
bus	P
driver	P
,	P
somebody	P
making	P
$	P
50,000	P
year	P
?	N
And	N
he	P
said	P
,	P
``	P
Yes	P

I	P

``	P
I	P

that	P
's	P
what	P

''	P
Well	N
,	N
I	C
fundamentally	C
disagree	C
with	C
that	C
.	N
I	C
think	C
what	C
grows	C
the	C
economy	C
is	C
when	C
you	C
get	C
that	C
tax	C
credit	C
that	C
we	C
put	C
in	C
place	C
for	C
your	C
kids	C
going	C
to	C
college	C
.	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
grows	C
the	C
economy	C
.	N
I	C
think	C
what	C
grows	C
the	C
economy	C
is	C
when	C
we	C
make	C
sure	C
small	C
businesses	C
are	C
getting	C
a	C
tax	C
credit	C
for	C
hiring	C
veterans	C
who	C
fought	C
for	C
our	C
country	C
.	N
That	P
grows	P
our	P
economy	P
.	N
So	N
we	N
just	N
have	N
a	N
different	N
theory	N
.	N
And	N
when	P
Governor	P
Romney	P
stands	P
here	P
,	P
after	P
a	P
year	P
of	P
campaigning	P
,	P
when	P
during	P
a	P
Republican	P
primary	P
he	P
stood	P
on	P
stage	P
and	P
said	P
``	P
I	P
'm	P
going	P
to	P
give	P
tax	P
cuts	P

--	N
he	P
did	P
n't	P
say	P

he	P
said	P
``	P

including	P
the	P

you	P
should	P

that	P

his	P

And	N
that	C

Several	N

It	N
was	N
to	N
go	N

read	N

100	N

when	N
that	N
time	N

was	N

I	N
remember	N
driving	N
down	N

California	N

one	N

My	N

full	N

I	N
was	N
going	N

we	N
did	N
about	N

I	N
could	N
n't	N
completely	N
neglect	N

around	N

with	N
that	N
thought	N

I	N
realized	N
what	N
a	N

whether	N
our	N
solution	N
was	N
beneficial	N
to	N
them	N
down	N
through	N
the	N
years	N
or	N
whether	N
it	N
hurt	N
them	N

They	N
would	N
also	N
know	N
that	N
we	N
lived	N

I	N
'll	N
tell	N
you	N
exactly	N
why	N

Because	N
the	P
deficit	P

building	P
up	P
for	P
12	P

I	N

what	N
I	N

can	N
be	N
done	N

I	C
think	C
we	C
can	C
bring	C
it	C
down	C
by	C
50	C
%	C
in	C
4	C
years	C
and	C
grow	C
the	C
economy	C

Now	N

I	P
could	P
get	P
rid	P
of	P
it	P
in	P
4	P
years	P
in	P
theory	P
on	P
the	P
books	P
now	P
,	N
but	N
to	P
do	P
it	P
you	P
'd	P
have	P
to	P
raise	P
taxes	P
too	P
much	P
and	P
cut	P
benefits	P
too	P
much	P
to	P
people	P
who	P
need	P
them	P
and	N
it	C
would	C
even	C
make	C
the	C
economy	C
worse	C
.	N
Mr	N
.	N
Perot	N
will	N
tell	N
you	N
,	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
that	N
the	N
expert	N
he	N
hired	N

analyze	N
his	N
plan	N
says	N
that	N
it	N
will	N
bring	N
the	N
deficit	N
down	N
in	N
5	N

it	N
will	N
make	N
unemployment	N
bad	N
for	N
4	N
more	N
years	N
.	N
So	N
my	N
view	N
is	N
,	N
sir	N

you	N
have	N
to	N
increase	N

We	C
got	C
a	C
big	C
philosophical	C
difference	C
here	C
tonight	C
between	N
one	P

it	P

way	P

And	N
so	N
I	C

the	C
answer	C

,	C
I	C
'm	C
going	C
to	C
win	C
it	C

my	P

for	P

renewal	P
,	N
and	N
also	N
I	C
think	C
that	C

pretty	C
much	C

a	C
free	C

On	N
looking	N

the	N

I	N
'm	N
the	N

But	N
he	P
's	P
an	P
incumbent	P

and	P
we	P
've	P
got	P
to	P
look	P
at	P
all	P
the	P
facts	P

They	P
're	P
almost	P
at	P
the	P
bottom	P
on	P
every	P

category	P

We	P
ca	P
n't	P
do	P
that	P
to	P
the	P
American	P
people	P
.	N
And	N
then	N
,	N
Helen	N
,	N
I	N
really	N
believe	N
where	N
people	N
are	N
going	N
to	N
ask	N
this	N
question	N
about	N
trust	N
,	N
because	N
I	C
do	C
think	C
there	C
's	C
a	C
pattern	C
by	C
Governor	C
Clinton	C
of	C
saying	C
one	C
thing	C
to	C
please	C
one	C
group	C
,	C
and	C
then	C
trying	C
to	C
please	C
another	C
group	C
.	N
And	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
pattern	C
is	C
a	C
dangerous	C
thing	C
to	C
suggest	C
would	C
work	C
for	C
the	C
Oval	C
Office	C
.	N
It	C
does	C
n't	C
work	C
that	C
way	C
when	C
you	C
're	C
president	C
.	N
Truman	P
is	P
right	P
.	P
The	P
buck	P
stops	P
there	P
.	N
And	N
you	P
have	P
to	P
make	P
decisions	P
even	P
when	P
it	P
's	P
against	P
your	P
own	P
interest	P
.	N
And	N
I	C
've	C
done	C
that	C
.	N
It	C
's	C
against	C
my	C
political	C
interest	C
to	C
say	C
go	C
ahead	C
and	C
go	C
along	C
with	C
the	C
tax	C
increase	C
,	C
but	C
I	C
did	C
what	C
I	C
thought	C
was	C
right	C
at	C
the	C
time	C
.	N
So	N
I	C
think	C
people	C
are	C
going	C
to	C
be	C
looking	C
for	C
trust	C
and	C
experience	C

And	N
then	N
,	N
I	N
mentioned	N
it	N
the	N
other	N

I	P
think	P
if	P
there	P

a	P

people	P
are	P
going	P
to	P

taken	P

and	P
we	P
trust	P
him	P

And	N
so	N
I	C

six	P

the	P

that	C
they	C
get	C
out	C

We	P
found	P
out	P
today	P
that	P
over	P
the	P
past	P
13	P
months	P

we	P
've	P
added	P
1.9	P
million	P
new	P
jobs	P
in	P
the	P
last	P
13	P

I	P
proposed	P
a	P

n't	C

today	C
it	C

KENNEDY	N

st-	P
strengthen	P

that	C
another	C

be	C
made	C
by	C
a	C

Administration	C
in	C

to	P
renew	P

I	C
hope	C
the	C

anything	N

a	P

left	P

local	P

end	P
up	P

more	P
of	P
a	P
burden	P

a	P
bunch	P
of	P
unfunded	P
mandates	P
,	N
the	P
same	P
kind	P
of	P
thing	P
that	P
happened	P
with	P
special	P
education	P
where	P
we	P
did	P
the	P
right	P
thing	P
by	P
saying	P
every	P
school	P
should	P
provide	P
education	P
to	P
kids	P
with	P
special	P
needs	P
,	P
but	P
we	P
never	P
followed	P
through	P
on	P
the	P
promise	P

a	C

today	N

an	P
economic	P
program	P
to	P
put	P
them	P
back	P

.	N
We	C
need	C
an	C
investment	C

to	C
modernize	C
plant	C

;	N
we	C

n't	C

we	C
need	C
a	C
tough	C

policy	C
that	C
is	C
fair	C

that	C

I	C

and	N
that	N
's	N
simply	N
why	N
I	P
proposed	P

15	P

did	C
it	C
as	C
a	C
security	C

because	N
I	P
would	P
rather	P
see	P
us	P
reduce	P

But	N
at	N
the	N
same	N
time	N
,	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
going	C
to	C
take	C
a	C
dramatic	C
measure	C
of	C
that	C
kind	C
to	C
convince	C
the	C
American	C
people	C
that	C
we	C
will	C
have	C
to	C
reduce	C
the	C
use	C
of	C
the	C
private	C
automobile	C

We	P
simply	P
can	P
not	P
have	P
people	P
sitting	P
one	P
behind	P
the	P
wheel	P
of	P
a	P

traffic	P
jams	P
going	P

out	P

our	P
great	P

We	C
are	C

resort	C

develop	C

,	N
so	P
that	P
with	P
buses	P

light	P

,	P
we	P
can	P
replace	P
the	P
private	P
automobile	P
in	P
those	P
places	P
where	P
it	P
clearly	P
is	P
not	P
energy-efficient	P
.	N
I	N
think	N
that	N
,	N
with	P
respect	P
to	P
housing	P
,	P
when	P
we	P
are	P
consuming	P
,	P
even	P
though	P
our	P
per	P

income	P
today	P
is	P
about	P
the	P
same	P
as	P
that	P
of	P
the	P
Federal	P
Republic	P
of	P
Germany	P
,	P
we	P
are	P
consuming	P
about	P
,	P
by	P
a	P
factor	P
of	P
two	P
,	P
the	P
amount	P
of	P
energy	P
that	P
they	P
consume	P
in	P
that	P
country	P
.	N
Surely	N
,	N
there	C
are	C
things	C
that	C
we	C
can	C
do	C
in	C
the	C
retrofitting	C
,	N
;	N
n	N
the	P
redesign	P
of	P
our	P
homes	P
,	P
not	P
only	P
of	P
our	P
houses	P
,	P
but	P
of	P
our	P
commercial	P
structures	P
,	P
as	P
well	P
,	P
that	P
will	P
make	P
it	P
possible	P
for	P
us	P
to	P
achieve	P
.	N
According	P
to	P
one	P
study	P
that	P
was	P
published	P
a	P
short	P
time	P
ago	P
-	P
the	P
Harvard	P
Business	P
School	P
study	P
-	P
indicated	P
that	P
just	P
in	P
the	P
commercial	P
sector	P
alone	P
of	P
the	P
economy	P
,	P
we	P
could	P
save	P
between	P
30	P
%	P
and	P
40	P
%	P
of	P
the	P
energy	P
that	P
we	P
consume	P
in	P
this	P
country	P
today	P

I	C
think	C

we	C
will	C
have	C
to	C
change	C

because	N
we	P

I	C

we	C

the	P

more	P
likely	P

make	P
a	P

The	P

made	P

The	P

It	P

that	P
will	P
continue	P
to	P
be	P
a	P
problem	P
for	P

we	C

the	C

The	P
Social	P

.	N
Because	N
you	P
have	P
to	P
remember	P
that	P
PAC	P
money	P
is	P
the	P
result	P
of	P
the	P
last	P
campaign	P
reform	P
bill	P
,	P
one	P
that	P
talks	P
about	P
employees	P
have	P
greater	P
participation	P
.	N
And	N
what	C
I	C
've	C
done	C
in	C
PAC	C
money	C
is	C
just	C
what	C
my	C
opponent	C
in	C
my	C
campaign	C
has	C
done	C
in	C
his	C
campaign	C
.	N
He	C
has	C
been	C
raising	C
PAC	C
money	C
,	C
too	C
.	N
So	N
what	C
you	C
have	C
to	C
do	C
is	C
comply	C
with	C
the	C
laws	C
as	C
they	C
are	C
,	C
whether	C
you	C
're	C

you	C

playing	C

Whether	C
you	C
like	C
those	C
laws	C

not	C

you	C
comply	C
with	C
them	C
.	N
Now	N
,	N
I	C
have	C
been	C
for	C
campaign	C
reform	C
,	C
and	C
have	C
pushed	C
it	C
very	C
hard	C
.	N
I	C
believe	C
that	C
we	C
have	C
to	C
do	C
some	C
things	C
in	C
that	C
regard	C
.	N
But	N
I	C
've	C
noticed	C
that	C
the	C
Senator	C
from	C
Indiana	C
has	C
opposed	C
that	C
campaign	C
reform	C
and	C
voted	C
repeatedly	C
against	C
it	C
.	N
The	C
things	C
we	C
have	C
to	C
do	C
,	C
I	C
believe	C
,	C
that	C
will	C
cut	C
back	C
on	C
soft	C
money	C
,	N
for	P
example	P
,	P
which	P
I	P
look	P
on	P
as	P
frankly	P
one	P
of	P
those	P
things	P
that	P
we	P
've	P
had	P
to	P
do	P
because	P
the	P
Republicans	P
have	P
done	P
it	P
for	P
so	P
long	P
.	N
But	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
a	C
loophole	C
,	C
frankly	C
.	N
But	N
campaign	C
reform	C
,	C
changing	C
the	C
rules	C
of	C
the	C
game	C
,	C
is	C
something	C
we	C
tried	C
repeatedly	C
in	C
this	C
session	C
of	C
the	C
Congress	C
,	C
but	C
only	C

the	C
Republicans	C
lead	C
the	C
charge	C
against	C
us	C
and	C
defeat	C
us	C

And	N
I	C
wish	C
that	C
Senator	C

would	C
change	C
his	C
mind	C
on	C
that	C

piece	C

give	C

under	C
the	C
circumstances	C
.	N
Saddam	P

resolution	P
not	P
to	P

Unfortunately	P
,	P
a	P

never	P
been	P
as	P
concerned	P
about	P
the	P
Kurds	P
as	P
the	P
United	P
States	P
has	P
tried	P
to	P
be	P
,	P
and	P
we	P
've	P
been	P
flying	P
an	P
operation	P
to	P
protect	P
them	P
out	P
of	P
Turkey	P
for	P
many	P
years	P
now	P
.	N
What	P
happened	P
was	P
one	P
of	P
the	P
Turkish	P
,	P
one	P
of	P
the	P
Kurdish	P
leaders	P
invited	P
him	P
to	P
go	P
up	P
north	P
,	P
but	P
we	P
felt	P
since	P
the	P
whole	P
world	P
community	P
had	P
told	P
him	P
not	P
to	P
do	P
it	P
,	P
that	P
once	P
he	P
did	P
it	P
we	P
had	P
to	P
do	P
something	P
.	N
We	P
did	P
not	P
feel	P
that	P
I	P
could	P
commit	P
.	N
I	P
certainly	P
did	P
n't	P
feel	P
I	P
should	P
commit	P
American	P
troops	P
to	P
throw	P
him	P
out	P
of	P
where	P
he	P
had	P
gone	P

and	N
that	C
was	C
the	C
only	C
way	C
to	C
do	C
that	C
.	N
So	N
the	C
appropriate	C
thing	C
strategically	C
to	C
do	C
was	C
to	C
reduce	C
his	C
ability	C
to	C
threaten	C
his	C
neighbors	C
.	N
We	P
did	P
that	P
by	P
expanding	P
what	P
's	P
called	P
the	P
no-fly	P
zone	P
by	P
increasing	P

it	P
fully	P

it	P

him	P

a	P

I	P

he	P
will	P
continue	P

I	C

this	C

something	C
the	C

people	C
see	C

I	C
think	C
they	C
also	C
know	C
that	C

had	C
a	C

today	P

the	P
school	P

the	P
words	P
from	P

we	C
find	C
35	C

with	C
task	C
forces	C
now	C
dealing	C
with	C
their	C
educational	C
problems	C

We	C
find	C
that	C
schools	C
are	C
extending	C
the	C
curriculum	C
to	C
now	C
have	C
forced	C
teaching	C

mathematics	C

science	C

so	C
forth	C

All	C
of	C
these	C

have	C
brought	C

I	C
think	C
that	C

the	P

those	N

What	N
he	N

he	C
wanted	C

what	N

refocused	P

And	N
we	C
are	C

where	C
we	C
have	C
met	C

3,000	P
American	P
deaths	P

And	N
so	N
we	P
decimated	P

we	C

now	C
in	C
a	C

we	C

there	P

no	P
reason	P

what	C
I	C

BUSH	N

North	C
Korea	C

first	C

I	C
do	C
.	N
Let	N
me	N
say	N
--	N
I	N
certainly	N
hope	N
so	N
.	N
Before	N
I	N
was	N
sworn	N
in	N
,	N
the	P
policy	P
of	P
this	P
government	P
was	P
to	P
have	P
bilateral	P
negotiations	P
with	P
North	P
Korea	P
.	N
And	N
we	P
signed	P
an	P
agreement	P
with	P
North	P
Korea	P
that	P
my	P
administration	P
found	P
out	P
that	P
was	P
not	P
being	P
honored	P
by	P
the	P
North	P
Koreans	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
I	C
decided	C
that	C
a	C
better	C
way	C
to	C
approach	C
the	C
issue	C
was	C
to	C
get	C
other	C
nations	C
involved	C
,	C
just	C
besides	C
us	C

And	N
in	P
Crawford	P
,	P
Texas	P
,	P
Jiang	P
Zemin	P
and	P
I	P
agreed	P
that	P
the	P
nuclear-weapons-free	P

,	P
Korean	P
Peninsula	P
,	P
was	P
in	P

our	P
interest	P
and	P
the	P
world	P
's	P
interest	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
we	C
began	C
a	C
new	C
dialogue	C
with	C
North	C
Korea	C
,	C
one	C
that	C
included	C
not	C
only	C
the	C
United	C

,	C
but	C
now	C
China	C
.	N
And	N
China	P
's	P
a	P
got	P
a	P
lot	P
of	P
influence	P
over	P
North	P
Korea	P

some	P
ways	P
more	P
than	P
we	P
do	P
.	N
As	N
well	N
,	N
we	P
included	P
South	P
Korea	P
,	P
Japan	P
and	P
Russia	P
.	N
So	N
now	P
there	P
are	P
five	P
voices	P
speaking	P
to	P
Kim	P
Jong	P
Il	P
,	P
not	P
just	P
one	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
if	C
Kim	C
Jong	C
Il	C
decides	C
again	C
to	C
not	C
honor	C
an	C
agreement	C

he	C
's	C
not	C
only	C

I	C

this	C
will	C
work	C

It	C
's	C
not	C

Thatâ€™s	C
what	C

I	C
happen	C
to	C
believe	C
that	C
the	C
Federal	C

has	C
usurped	C
powers	C

there	P
are	P
more	P

Now	N

to	N
why	N
I	N
should	N

President	P

invented	P
a	P
thing	P
he	P
called	P
the	P
misery	P
index	P

He	P
added	P
the	P
rate	P

the	P
rate	P

inflation	P

it	P
came	P

at	P
that	P
time	P

to	P
12.5	P
%	P
under	P
President	P

a	P

Today	P

by	P
his	P

the	P

is	P
in	P
excess	P

20	P

I	C
think	C
this	C

something	C

And	N
today	C

you	C

that	C

of	P
the	P
problems	P
that	P
we	P

that	P
we	P

much	P
more	P
powerful	P

any	P

been	P
in	P

some	P

made	P
recommendations	P
that	P

set	P
up	P
which	P
the	P

would	P
like	P
much	P
better	P
than	P
a	P

than	P
to	P
participate	P
in	P
the	P

Now	N

four	P

that	C

about	P

the	N
reason	N

had	P
a	P

more	P

the	C
extraordinary	C

's	P
going	P

reason	C
we	C
have	C
been	C
in	C
such	C
a	C
enormous	C
economic	C

Now	N

it	C

You	P
had	P

the	C
best	C
way	C

to	C
be	C
safe	C

for	C

be	C
trained	C

do	C
the	C

that	C

what	C
we	C

We	P
've	P

the	C
best	C

We	C
'll	C
never	C
succeed	C
in	C

if	C
the	C
Iraqi	C

do	C

do	C
a	C
better	C
job	C
of	C

I	C
'm	C
going	C

My	N
answer	N
to	N
you	N
is	N
in	C
the	C
short-term	C
we	C
need	C
to	C
get	C
after	C
it	C
here	C
in	C
America	C
.	N
We	C
need	C
to	C
explore	C
our	C
resources	C
and	N
we	C
need	C
to	C
develop	C
our	C
reservoirs	C
of	C
domestic	C
production	C
.	N
We	C
also	C
need	C
to	C
have	C
a	C
hemispheric	C
energy	C
policy	C
where	C
Canada	C
,	C
Mexico	C
and	C
the	C
United	C
States	C
come	C
together	C
.	N
I	P
brought	P
this	P
up	P
recently	P
with	P
Vincent	P
Fox	P
the	P
newly	P
elected	P
president	P
in	P
Mexico	P
,	P
he	P
's	P
a	P
man	P
I	P
know	P
from	P
Mexico	P
.	N
I	P
talked	P
to	P
him	P
about	P
how	P
best	P
to	P
expedite	P
the	P
exploration	P
of	P
natural	P
gas	P
in	P
Mexico	P
and	P
transport	P
it	P
up	P
to	P
the	P
United	P

we	P
become	P
less	P
dependent	P
on	P
foreign	P

This	P
is	P
a	P
major	P

The	P

PEROT	N

the	C

that	C

a	C

the	C
way	C
the	C

a	P
government	P
that	P
comes	P
from	P

Over	P
time	P
we	P
have	P
developed	P
a	P
government	P
that	P
comes	P
at	P
the	P

that	P
comes	P
from	P
the	P
top	P

where	P
the	P
people	P
are	P
more	P

less	P
treated	P
as	P
objects	P
to	P

The	P
thing	P
that	P
separates	P
my	P

makes	P
it	P

is	P
that	P
this	P

my	N
fellow	N
Americans	N

Since	P
this	P
campaign	P
began	P
I	P
have	P
had	P
a	P
very	P
rare	P
privilege	P
.	N
I	P
have	P
traveled	P
to	P
forty-eight	P
of	P
the	P
fifty	P
states	P
and	P
in	P
my	P
travels	P
I	P
have	P
learned	P
what	P
the	P
people	P
of	P
the	P
United	P
States	P
are	P
thinking	P
about	P
.	N
There	C
is	C
one	C
issue	C
that	C
stands	C
out	C
above	C
all	C
the	C
rest	C
,	C
one	C
in	C
which	C
every	C
American	C
is	C
concerned	C
,	C
regardless	C
of	C
what	C
group	C
he	C
may	C
be	C
a	C
member	C
and	C
regardless	C
of	C
where	C
he	C
may	C
live	C
.	N
And	N
that	C
issue	C
,	C
very	C
simply	C
stated	C
,	C
is	C
this	C
:	C
how	C
can	C
we	C
keep	C
the	C
peace	C
-	C
keep	C
it	C
without	C
surrender	C
?	C
How	C
can	C
we	C
extend	C
freedom	C
-	C
extend	C
it	C
without	C
war	C
?	C
Now	N
in	C
determining	C
how	C
we	C
deal	C
with	C
this	C
issue	C
,	C
we	C
must	C
find	C
the	C
answer	C
to	C
a	C
very	C
important	C
but	C
simple	C
question	C
:	C
who	C
threatens	C
the	C
peace	C
?	C
Who	C
threatens	C
freedom	C
in	C
the	C
world	C
?	C
There	C
is	C
only	C
one	C
threat	C
to	C
peace	C
and	C
one	C
threat	C
to	C
freedom	C
-	C
that	C
that	C
is	C
presented	C
by	C
the	C
international	C
Communist	C
movement	C
.	N
And	N
therefore	N
if	C
we	C
are	C
to	C
have	C
peace	C
,	C
we	C
must	C
know	C
how	C
to	C
deal	C
with	C
the	C
Communists	C
and	C
their	C
leaders	C
.	N
I	P
know	P
Mr	P

Khrushchev	P
.	N
I	P
also	P
have	P
had	P
the	P
opportunity	P
of	P
knowing	P
and	P
meeting	P
other	P
Communist	P
leaders	P
in	P
the	P
world	P
.	N
I	P
believe	P
there	P
are	P
certain	P
principles	P
we	P
must	P
find	P
in	P
dealing	P
with	P
him	P
and	P
his	P
colleagues	P
-	P
principles	P
,	P
if	P
followed	P
,	P
that	P
will	P
keep	P
the	P
peace	P
and	P
that	P
also	P
can	P
extend	P
freedom	P
.	N
First	N
,	N
we	C
have	C
to	C
learn	C
from	C
the	C
past	C
,	N
because	N
we	P
can	P
not	P
afford	P
to	P
make	P
the	P
mistakes	P
of	P
the	P
past	P
.	N
In	P
the	P
seven	P
years	P
before	P
this	P
Administration	P
came	P
into	P
power	P
in	P
Washington	P
,	P
we	P
found	P
that	P
six	P
hundred	P
million	P
people	P
went	P
behind	P
the	P
Iron	P
Curtain	P
.	N
And	N
at	P
the	P
end	P
of	P
that	P
seven	P
years	P
we	P
were	P
engaged	P
in	P
a	P
war	P
in	P
Korea	P
which	P
cost	P
of	P
thirty	P
thousand	P
American	P
lives	P
.	N
In	P
the	P
past	P
seven	P
years	P
,	P
in	P
President	P
Eisenhower	P
's	P
Administration	P
,	P
this	P
situation	P
has	P
been	P
reversed	P
.	N
We	P
ended	P
the	P
Korean	P
War	P
;	N
by	P
strong	P
,	P
firm	P
leadership	P
we	P
have	P
kept	P
out	P
of	P
other	P
wars	P
;	N
and	N
we	P
have	P
avoided	P
surrender	P
of	P
principle	P
or	P
territory	P
at	P
the	P
conference	P
table	P
.	N
Now	N
why	N
were	N
we	N
successful	N
,	N
as	N
our	N
predecessors	N
were	N
not	N
successful	N
?	N
I	C
think	C
there	C
're	C
several	C
reasons	C
.	N
In	C
the	C
first	C
place	C
,	C
they	C
made	C
a	C
fatal	C
error	C
in	C
misjudging	C
the	C
Communists	C
;	N
in	P
trying	P
to	P
apply	P
to	P
them	P
the	P
same	P
rules	P
of	P
conduct	P
that	P
you	P
would	P
apply	P
to	P
the	P
leaders	P
of	P
the	P
free	P
world	P
.	N
One	C
of	C
the	C
major	C
errors	C
they	C
made	C
was	C
the	C
one	C
that	C
led	C
to	C
the	C
Korean	C
War	C
.	N
In	P
ruling	P
out	P
the	P
defense	P
of	P
Korea	P
,	P
they	P
invited	P
aggression	P
in	P
that	P
area	P
.	N
They	P
thought	P
they	P
were	P
going	P
to	P
have	P
peace	P
-	P
it	P
brought	P
war	P
.	N
We	C
learned	C
from	C
their	C
mistakes	C
.	N
And	N
so	N
,	N
in	P
our	P
seven	P
years	P
,	P
we	P
find	P
that	P
we	P
have	P
been	P
firm	P
in	P
our	P
diplomacy	P
;	N
we	P
have	P
never	P
made	P
concessions	P
without	P
getting	P
concessions	P
in	P
return	P
.	N
We	P
have	P
always	P
been	P
willing	P
to	P
go	P
the	P
extra	P
mile	P
to	P
negotiate	P
for	P
disarmament	P
or	P
in	P
any	P
other	P
area	P
.	N
But	N
we	P
have	P
never	P
been	P
willing	P
to	P
do	P
anything	P
that	P
,	P
in	P
effect	P
,	P
surrendered	P
freedom	P
any	P
place	P
in	P
the	P
world	P
.	N
That	C
is	C
why	C
President	C
Eisenhower	C
was	C
correct	C
in	C
not	C
apologizing	C

voted	P

this	N

why	N
was	N
the	N
President	N
right	N
and	N
his	N
critics	N
wrong	N
?	N
Because	N
again	N
this	P
showed	P
a	P
lack	P
of	P
understanding	P
of	P
dictators	P
,	P
a	P
lack	P
of	P
understanding	P
particularly	P
of	P
Communists	P
,	N
because	N
every	C
time	C
you	C
make	C
such	C
a	C
concession	C
it	C
does	C
not	C
lead	C

it	C
only	C

It	C
encourages	C
them	C
to	C
begin	C
a	C
war	C
.	N
And	N
so	N
I	N
say	N
that	N
the	P
record	P
shows	P
that	P
we	P
know	P
how	P
to	P
keep	P
the	P
peace	P
,	P
to	P
keep	P
it	P
without	P
surrender	P
.	N
Let	N
us	N
move	N
now	N
to	N
the	N
future	N
.	N
It	C
is	C
not	C
enough	C
to	C
stand	C
on	C
this	C
record	C
because	N
we	P
are	P
dealing	P
with	P
the	P
most	P
ruthless	P
,	P
fanatical	P
...	P
leaders	P
that	P
the	P
world	P
has	P
ever	P
seen	P
.	N
That	N
is	N
why	N
I	N
say	N
that	N
in	C
this	C
period	C
of	C
the	C
sixties	C
,	C
America	C
must	C
move	C
forward	C
in	C
every	C
area	C
.	N
First	N
of	N
all	N
,	N
although	P
we	P
are	P
today	P
,	P
as	P
Senator	P
Kennedy	P
has	P
admitted	P
,	P
the	P
strongest	P
nation	P
in	P
the	P
world	P
militarily	P
,	P
we	P
must	P
increase	P
our	P
strength	P
,	P
increase	P
it	P
so	P
that	P
we	P
will	P
always	P
have	P
enough	P
strength	P
that	P
regardless	P
of	P
what	P
our	P
potential	P
opponents	P
have	P
-	P
if	P
the	P
should	P
launch	P
a	P
surprise	P
attack	P
-	P
we	P
will	P
be	P
able	P
to	P
destroy	P
their	P
war-making	P
capability	P
.	N
They	C
must	C
know	C
,	C
in	C
other	C
words	C
,	C
that	C
it	C
is	C
national	C
suicide	C
if	C
they	C
begin	C
anything	C
.	N
We	C
need	C
this	C
kind	C
of	C
strength	C
because	N
we	P
're	P
the	P
guardians	P
of	P
the	P
peace	P
.	N
In	N
addition	N
to	N
military	N
strength	N
,	N
we	C
need	C
to	C
see	C
that	C
the	C
economy	C
of	C
this	C
country	C
continues	C
to	C
grow	C
.	N
It	P
has	P
grown	P
in	P
the	P
past	P
seven	P
years	P
.	N
It	C
can	C
and	C
will	C
grow	C
even	C
more	C
in	C
the	C
next	C
four	C
.	N
And	N
the	N
reason	N
that	N
it	N
must	N
grow	N
even	N
more	N
is	N
because	N
we	P
have	P
things	P
to	P
do	P
at	P
home	P
and	N
also	N
because	N
we	P
're	P
in	P
a	P
race	P
for	P
survival	P
-	P
a	P
race	P
in	P
which	P
it	P
is	P
n't	P
enough	P
to	P
be	P
ahead	P
;	P
it	P
is	P
n't	P
enough	P
simply	P
to	P
be	P
complacent	P
.	N
We	C
have	C
to	C
move	C
ahead	C
in	C
order	C
to	C
stay	C
ahead	C
.	N
And	N
that	P
is	P
why	P
,	P
in	P
this	P
field	P
,	P
I	P
have	P
made	P
recommendations	P
which	P
I	P
am	P
confident	P
will	P
move	P
the	P
American	P
economy	P
ahead	P
-	P
move	P
it	P
firmly	P
and	P
soundly	P
so	P
that	P
there	P
will	P
never	P
be	P
a	P
time	P
when	P
the	P
Soviet	P
Union	P
will	P
be	P
able	P
to	P
challenge	P
our	P
superiority	P
in	P
this	P
field	P
.	N
And	N
so	N
we	C
need	C
military	C
strength	C
,	N
we	C
need	C
economic	C
strength	C
,	N
we	C
also	C
need	C
the	C
right	C
diplomatic	C
policies	C
.	N
What	N
are	N
they	N
?	N
Again	N
we	P
turn	P
to	P
the	P
past	P
.	N
Firmness	P
but	P
no	P
belligerence	P
,	P
and	P
by	P
no	P
belligerence	P
I	P
mean	P
that	P
we	P
do	P
not	P
answer	P
insult	P
by	P
insult	P
.	N
When	P
you	P
are	P
proud	P
and	P
confident	P
of	P
your	P
strength	P
,	P
you	P
do	P
not	P
get	P
down	P
to	P
the	P
level	P
of	P
Mr	P
.	P
Khrushchev	P
and	P
his	P
colleagues	P
.	N
And	N
that	P
example	P
that	P
President	P
Eisenhower	P
has	P
set	P
we	P
will	P
continue	P
to	P
follow	P
.	N
But	N
all	C
this	C
by	C
itself	C
is	C
not	C
enough	C
.	N
It	C
is	C
not	C
enough	C
for	C
us	C
simply	C
to	C
be	C
the	C
strongest	C
nation	C
militarily	C
,	C
the	C
strongest	C
economically	C
,	C
and	C
also	C
to	C
have	C
firm	C
diplomacy	C
.	N
We	C
must	C
have	C
a	C
great	C
goal	C
.	N
And	N
that	C
is	C
:	C
not	C
just	C
to	C
keep	C

for	C

to	C
extend	C
it	C
to	C

to	C
extend	C
it	C
to	C
all	C

because	N
that	P

's	P

To	C
extend	C
it	C
to	C
all	C

the	P

is	P
not	P
to	P

to	P

And	N
you	C
can	C
not	C

a	C

a	C

so	P
I	P

that	P

a	N

was	N

It	P

Now	N

it	C
is	C

that	N
we	C

employ	C
a	C

means	C
additional	C
troops	C

,	N
by	N

it	P
's	P
not	P
just	P
the	P

's	C
a	C

OBAMA	N
:	N
Yes	C
,	C
I	C
think	C
we	C
need	C
more	C
troops	C

I	N
've	N
been	N
saying	N
that	N
for	N
over	N
a	N
year	N
now	N
.	N
And	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
we	C
have	C
to	C
do	C
it	C
as	C
quickly	C
as	C
possible	C
,	N
because	N
it	P
's	P
been	P
acknowledged	P
by	P
the	P
commanders	P
on	P
the	P
ground	P
the	P
situation	P
is	P
getting	P
worse	P
,	P
not	P
better	P
.	N
We	C
had	C
the	C
highest	C
fatalities	C
among	C
U.S	C
.	C
troops	C
this	C
past	C
year	C
than	C
at	C
any	C
time	C
since	C
2002	C
.	N
And	N
we	P
are	P
seeing	P
a	P
major	P
offensive	P
taking	P
place	P
--	P
Al	P
Qaida	P
and	P
Taliban	P
crossing	P
the	P
border	P
and	P
attacking	P
our	P
troops	P
in	P
a	P
brazen	P
fashion	P
.	N
They	N
are	N
feeling	N
emboldened	N
.	N
And	N
we	C
can	C
not	C
separate	C
Afghanistan	C
from	C
Iraq	C
,	N
because	N
what	P
our	P
commanders	P
have	P
said	P
is	P
we	P
do	P
n't	P
have	P
the	P
troops	P
right	P
now	P
to	P
deal	P
with	P
Afghanistan	P
.	N
So	N
I	C
would	C
send	C
two	C
to	C
three	C
additional	C
brigades	C
to	C
Afghanistan	C
.	N
Now	N
,	N
keep	N
in	N
mind	N
that	N
we	C
have	C
four	C
times	C
the	C
number	C
of	C
troops	C
in	C
Iraq	C
,	N
where	P
nobody	P
had	P
anything	P
to	P
do	P
with	P
9/11	P
before	P
we	P
went	P
in	P
,	N
where	P
,	P
in	P
fact	P
,	P
there	P
was	P
no	P
Al	P
Qaida	P
before	P
we	P
went	P
in	P
,	N
but	N
we	C
have	C
four	C
times	C
more	C
troops	C
there	C
than	C
we	C
do	C
in	C
Afghanistan	C
.	N
And	N
that	C
is	C
a	C
strategic	C
mistake	C
,	N
because	N
every	P
intelligence	P
agency	P
will	P
acknowledge	P
that	P
Al	P
Qaida	P
is	P
the	P
greatest	P
threat	P
against	P
the	P
United	P
States	P
and	N
that	P
Secretary	P
of	P
Defense	P
Gates	P
acknowledged	P
the	P
central	P
front	P
--	N
that	P
the	P
place	P
where	P
we	P
have	P
to	P
deal	P
with	P
these	P
folks	P
is	P
going	P
to	P
be	P
in	P
Afghanistan	P
and	P
in	P
Pakistan	P

So	N
here	N
's	N
what	N
we	N
have	N
to	N
do	N
comprehensively	N

though	N

When	P

inevitably	C
in	C
my	C
opinion	C

it	C
will	C
acquire	C
the	C
power	C

tell	C

the	P

my	C

Well	N
,	N
let	N
me	N
just	N
correct	N
something	N
very	N
quickly	N
.	N
I	C
believe	C
the	C
Republican	C
Guard	C
of	C
Iran	C
is	C
a	C
terrorist	C
organization	C
.	N
I	N
've	N
consistently	N
said	N
so	N
.	N
What	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
refers	P
to	P
is	P
a	P
measure	P
in	P
the	P
Senate	P
that	P
would	P
try	P
to	P
broaden	P
the	P
mandate	P
inside	P
of	P
Iraq	P
.	N
To	P
deal	P
with	P
Iran	P
.	N
And	N
ironically	N
,	N
the	C
single	C
thing	C
that	C
has	C
strengthened	C
Iran	C
over	C
the	C
last	C
several	C
years	C
has	C
been	C
the	C
war	C
in	C
Iraq	C
.	N
Iraq	C
was	C
Iran	C
's	C
mortal	C
enemy	C
.	N
That	N
was	N
cleared	N
away	N
.	N
And	N
what	N
we	C
've	C
seen	C
over	C
the	C
last	C
several	C
years	C
is	C
Iran	C
's	C
influence	C
grow	C
.	N
They	P
have	P
funded	P
Hezbollah	P
,	N
they	P
have	P
funded	P
Hamas	P
,	N
they	P
have	P
gone	P
from	P
zero	P
centrifuges	P
to	P
4,000	P
centrifuges	P
to	P
develop	P
a	P
nuclear	P
weapon	P
.	N
So	N
obviously	N
,	N
our	C
policy	C
over	C
the	C
last	C
eight	C
years	C
has	C
not	C
worked	C
.	N
Senator	P
McCain	P
is	P
absolutely	P
right	P
,	N
we	C
can	C
not	C
tolerate	C
a	C
nuclear	C
Iran	C
.	N
It	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
game	N
changer	N
.	N
Not	N
only	N
would	N
it	N
threaten	N
Israel	N
,	N
a	N
country	N
that	N
is	N
our	N
stalwart	N
ally	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
would	N
also	N
create	N
an	N

you	N

here	N
's	N
what	N
we	N
need	N
to	N
do	N

We	C
do	C
need	C
tougher	C
sanctions	C

I	P
do	P
not	P
agree	P
with	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
that	P
we	P
're	P
going	P
to	P
be	P
able	P
to	P
execute	P
the	P
kind	P
of	P
sanctions	P
we	P
need	P
without	P
some	P
cooperation	P
with	P
countries	P
like	P
Russia	P
and	P
China	P
that	N
are	N

I	N

would	N
agree	N
,	N
not	N

have	P
extensive	P
trade	P

does	C
n't	C
have	C
a	C
nuclear	C

But	N
we	C
are	C
also	C
going	C
to	C
have	C
to	C
,	C
I	C
believe	C
,	C
engage	C
in	C
tough	C
direct	C
diplomacy	C
with	C
Iran	C
and	N
this	P
is	P
a	P
major	P
difference	P
I	P
have	P
with	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
,	N
this	C
notion	C
that	C
by	C

are	C
punishing	C

In	N
each	N

our	C

accelerated	C

not	P
get	P
one	P

at	N

I	C
think	C
four	C

send	C

I	C
do	C
n't	C
say	C
the	C
Democrats	C
are	C
united	C

their	C
support	C
of	C
the	C
program	C

I	C
do	C

a	C
majority	C

I	C
say	C
a	C
majority	C

the	C

opposed	C
to	C
it	C

The	N
third	N
is	N
medical	N
care	N
for	N
the	N
aged	N
which	N
is	N
tied	N

which	N
is	N
financed	N
out	N

It	C
does	C
not	C
put	C
a	C
deficit	C
on	C
the	C
Treasury	C
.	C
The	P
proposal	P
advanced	P
by	P
you	P
and	P
by	P
Mr	P

Javits	P
would	P
have	P
cost	P
six	P
hundred	P

Mr	P

Rockefeller	P
rejected	P
it	P
in	P
New	P

I	P
live	P

both	P

But	N
I	C
believe	C

some	C
way	C
of	C
checking	C

age	C

Therefore	N
I	C
support	C
the	C

would	C
impose	C

until	C
a	C

what	C
only	C

now	C

Once	P

you	P
do	P
n't	P
have	P
to	P

at	P

you	P
can	P
check	P

I	C
also	C
think	C
we	C
should	C
have	C
frankly	C
restrictions	C
on	C
assault	C
weapons	C
whose	C
only	C
purpose	C
is	C
to	C

it	P
's	P
very	P
important	P

There	P
is	P
a	P

would	P
put	P

we	C
reduce	C

BUSH	N
:	N
Well	N
,	N
that	N
's	N
a	N
great	N
question	N
.	N
I	C
think	C
one	C
of	C
the	C
problems	C
we	C
have	C
,	C
particularly	C
for	C
seniors	C
,	C
is	C
there	C
is	C
no	C
prescription	C
drug	C
coverage	C
in	C
Medicare	C
.	N
And	N
therefore	N
,	N
when	C
they	C
have	C
to	C
try	C
to	C
purchase	C
drugs	C
they	C
do	C
so	C
on	C
their	C
own	C
,	C
there	C
's	C
no	C
kind	C
of	C
collective	C
bargaining	C
,	C
no	C
power	C
of	C
purchasing	C
among	C
seniors	C
.	N
So	N
I	C
think	C
step	C
one	C
to	C
make	C
sure	C
prescription	C
drugs	C
is	C
more	C
affordable	C
for	C
seniors	C
,	N
and	N
those	C
are	C
the	C
folks	C
who	C
really	C
rely	C
upon	C
prescription	C
drugs	C
a	C
lot	C
these	C
days	C
,	C
is	C
to	C
reform	C
the	C
Medicare	C
system	C
,	C
is	C
to	C
have	C
prescription	C
drugs	C
as	C
an	C
integral	C
part	C
of	C
Medicare	C
once	C
and	C
for	C
all	C
.	N
The	C
problem	C
we	C
have	C
today	C
is	C
like	C
the	C
patient	C
's	C
bill	C
of	C
rights	C
,	C
particularly	C
with	C
health	C
care	C
,	C
there	C
's	C
a	C
lot	C
of	C
bickering	C
in	C
Washington	C
,	C
D.C	C
.	N
It	P
's	P
kind	P
of	P
like	P
a	P
political	P
issue	P
as	P
opposed	P
to	P
a	P
people	P
issue	P
.	N
So	N
what	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
I	C
want	C
to	C
call	C
upon	C
Republicans	C
and	C
Democrats	C
to	C
forget	C
all	C
the	C
arguing	C
and	C
finger	C
pointing	C
,	C
and	C
come	C
together	C
and	C
take	C
care	C
of	C
our	C
seniors	C
'	C

that	C

we	C
'll	C

we	C
'll	C

all	C

with	C

In	N
the	N
meantime	N
,	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
important	C

what	C

Immediate	C

which	C

that	N

do	C
n't	C
have	C
to	C

The	N
purchasing	N

And	N
I	C
'm	C

I	C

would	C
hurt	C
our	C
ability	C
to	C
continue	C

Drug	N

a	N

we	N
used	N

One	C
of	C
the	C
most	C

is	C
to	C

'm	C

Expediting	C

Allowing	C
the	C
new	C

passed	C

First	N
of	N
all	N
,	N
I	C

That	N
's	N
why	N
I	C
strongly	C
supported	C
the	C
Motor	C
Voter	C
law	C
.	N
There	P
was	P
a	P
big	P
story	P
I	P
think	P
in	P
U.S.A	P
.	N
Today	C
of	C
the	C
millions	C
of	C

who	C

now	C
registered	C

it	C

Secondly	N
,	N
I	C
think	C
we	C
need	C
to	C
look	C
at	C
making	C
the	C
elections	C
more	C
accessible	C
.	N
You	N

several	P

three	P

it	P

hard	P
for	P
them	P

just	P
get	P
there	P
and	P
vote	P
.	N
Third	N
thing	N
I	C
think	C
we	C
need	C
is	C
more	C
forums	C
like	C
this	C
,	N
which	N
is	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
reasons	N
I	C
have	C
so	C
strongly	C
supported	C
campaign	C
finance	C
reform	C
.	N
Because	N
if	P
you	P
want	P
to	P
cut	P
the	P
cost	P
of	P
campaigns	P
,	P
you	P
have	P
to	P
open	P
the	P
airways	P
,	N
because	N
what	P
drives	P
the	P
cost	P
of	P
campaigns	P
are	P
the	P
cost	P
of	P
advertising	P
on	P
television	P
,	P
radio	P
,	P
newspaper	P
,	P
mass	P

And	N
if	P
you	P
open	P
the	P
airways	P
to	P
more	P
things	P
like	P
this	P
,	P
you	P
see	P
it	P
's	P
not	P
just	P
you	P
that	P
are	P
participating	P
here	P

For	P
every	P
one	P
of	P
you	P
who	P
stood	P
up	P
here	P
and	P
asked	P
a	P
question	P
tonight	P
,	P
I	P
promise	P
you	P
there	P
's	P
a	P
100,000	P
Americans	P

I	P
wish	P
I	P
could	P
have	P
asked	P
that	P
question	P

So	N
I	C
think	C
we	C
have	C
to	C
change	C
the	C
nature	C
of	C
politics	C

The	N
last	N
thing	N
I	C

we	C

something	C
I	C
have	C

do	C

do	C
something	C

a	C

way	C

I	C
try	C
to	C
have	C
a	C
real	C
American	C
citizen	C
there	C
who	C
is	C
directly	C
affected	C
by	C
it	C
so	C
that	C
people	C
can	C
see	C
the	C
connection	C
of	C
what	C
happens	C
way	C
across	C
the	C
country	C

do	P

back	P

21st	N

There	N
's	N
no	N
doubt	N
that	N
we	N
have	N
achieved	N
equal	N
access	N

what	N
is	N
the	N
advantage	N
in	N

So	N
choice	C
and	C
competition	C
amongst	C

is	C
one	C
of	C
the	C
key	C
elements	C

we	P
find	P
bad	P

And	N
we	C
have	C
to	C
be	C
able	C
to	C
give	C

the	C

choice	C

that	C

the	P
only	P
answer	P

they	P
're	P

They	P
are	P

the	P
kind	P

upgraded	P
both	P

Now	N

throwing	C

There	N
is	N
no	N

that	N
we	C

position	C

There	N
is	N
no	N
question	N
but	N
that	N
this	C
nation	C
can	C
not	C
stand	C
still	C
;	N
because	N
we	P
are	P
in	P
a	P
deadly	P
competition	P
,	P
a	P
competition	P
not	P
only	P
with	P
the	P

the	P

We	C
're	C
ahead	C

this	C
competition	C

as	C
Senator	C

,	C
I	C
think	C

But	N
when	N
you	N

in	N
a	N

the	N
only	N
way	N
to	N
stay	N

to	N
move	N
ahead	N

And	N
I	C
subscribe	C
completely	C
to	C
the	C
spirit	C
that	C
Senator	C

expressed	C
tonight	C

the	C
spirit	C
that	C

move	C

Where	N
,	N
then	N
,	N
do	N
we	N
disagree	N
?	N
I	C
think	C
we	C
disagree	C
on	C
the	C
implication	C
of	C
his	C
remarks	C
tonight	C

on	C
the	C

that	C
he	C
has	C
made	C
on	C
many	C
occasions	C
during	C
his	C
campaign	C
to	C
the	C
effect	C
that	C
the	C
United	C

has	C
been	C
standing	C
still	C

We	N
heard	N
tonight	N
,	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
the	N
statement	N
made	N
that	N
our	P
growth	P
in	P
national	P
product	P
last	P

was	P
the	P
lowest	P
of	P
any	P

Now	N
last	N

when	P

this	P

that	C

nine-tenths	C

is	N
this	N
:	N
Senator	N

suggested	N
in	N

that	N
we	N
lack	N
compassion	N

the	N
poor	N

for	N
the	N
old	N

and	N
for	N

that	N
are	N
unfortunate	N

Let	N
us	N
understand	N
throughout	N
this	N
campaign	N
that	N
his	N
motives	N
and	N
mine	N
are	N
sincere	N

it	C

Senator	C

feels	C

deeply	C
about	C
these	C

as	C
I	C
do	C

but	N
our	C
disagreement	C
is	C
not	C
about	C

I	P
've	P

critical	P
of	P
the	P

's	P
failure	P

would	P
make	P
it	P
possible	P
for	P
us	P

for	P

closer	P

after	P
the	P
fifty-five-fifty-six	P

But	N
there	P
was	P
a	P
period	P
there	P
when	P
Poland	P
demonstrated	P
a	P
national	P
independence	P
and	P
even	P
the	P
Polish	P

moved	P
some	P
differn-	P
di-	P
distance	P
away	P
from	P
the	P
Soviet	P

I	P
suggested	P
that	P
we	P
amend	P

so	P
that	P
we	P
could	P
enjoy	P
closer	P

We	P
received	P
the	P
support	P
first	P
of	P
the	P
Administration	P

then	P
not	P

we	P
were	P
defeated	P
by	P

it	P

n't	P

I	N
would	N

the	C
area	C
of	C
vulnerability	C
of	C

uh	C

the	C

They	P

whether	P

what	N
that	N

I	C
think	C
the	C
next	C
president	C

the	C
United	C

watch	C
it	C

it	P

great	P
effects	P
throughout	P
the	P

.	N
Thirdly	N
,	N
I	C
believe	C
that	C
India	C
represents	C
a	C
great	C
area	C
for	C
affirmative	C
action	C
by	C
the	C
free	C
world	C

India	P
started	P
from	P
about	P
the	P

place	P
that	P
China	P
did	P
.	N
Chinese	P
Communists	P
have	P
been	P
moving	P
ahead	P
the	P
last	P
ten	P
years	P
.	N
India	P
under	P
a	P
free	P
society	P
has	P
been	P
making	P
some	P
progress	P
.	N
But	N
if	C
India	C
does	C
not	C
succeed	C
-	C
with	C
her	C
four	C
hundred	C
and	C
fifty	C
million	C
people	C
,	C
if	C
she	C
ca	C
n't	C
make	C
freedom	C
work	C
-	C
then	C
people	C
around	C
the	C
world	C
are	C
going	C
to	C
determine	C
-	C
particularly	C
in	C
the	C
underdeveloped	C
world	C
-	C
that	C
the	C
only	C
way	C
that	C
they	C
can	C
develop	C
their	C

is	C
through	C
the	C
Communist	C
system	C

Fourth	N
,	N
let	N
me	N

in	C
Africa	C

Asia	C
,	C
Latin	C
America	C
,	C
Eastern	C
Europe	C
,	C
the	C
great	C
force	C
on	C
our	C
side	C
is	C
the	C
desire	C
of	C
people	C
to	C
be	C
free	C
.	N
This	P
has	P
expressed	P
itself	P
in	P
the	P

expressed	P

.	N
They	C
want	C
to	C
be	C
free	C

And	N
my	C
judgment	C
is	C
that	C
they	C
do	C
n't	C
want	C
to	C
give	C
their	C
freedom	C
up	C
to	C
become	C

They	C
want	C

stay	C

but	C
certainly	C
independent	C
of	C

And	N
I	C
believe	C
if	C
we	C

One	N
of	N

I	N

you	N

,	N
you	N

my	C
fundamental	C

give	C

possible	C

explanation	N

you	N

I	C
think	C
part	C

the	C
answer	C
to	C
this	C
haunting	C
of	C
these	C
children	C
that	C

suffering	C
lies	C

the	C

maybe	C
we	C

But	N
,	N
Peter	N

so	N
much	N
of	N
it	N

gets	N
into	N

talking	N

the	C
crime	C

that	C

why	C
I	C
'm	C
a	C

believer	C
in	C
trying	C

control	C

in	C

why	C
I	C

so	N
it	P
's	P
a	P

do	N

the	P
work	P

learn	P

I	P

we	P

come	P
to	P

agreement	P
because	P
it	P
does	P
not	P
merely	P
involve	P
now	P
the	P

Britain	P

France	P

the	P
Soviet	P

as	P
atomic	P
powers	P

Because	N
new	P
breakthroughs	P
in	P
atomic	P
energy	P
technology	P
there	P
's	P
some	P
indications	P
that	P
by	P
the	P
time	P
the	P
next	P
president	P
's	P
term	P
of	P
office	P
has	P
come	P
to	P
an	P
end	P

there	P
may	P
be	P
ten	P
,	P
fifteen	P
,	P
or	P
twenty	P
countries	P
with	P
an	P
atomic	P
capacity	P
,	P
perhaps	P
that	P
many	P

all	P
the	P

that	P

one	C
more	C

n't	C

will	C
be	C

I	C

responsibility	C

clearly	C
on	C

then	C
we	C

there	C
may	C
have	C

be	C

Atomic	C

that	P

how	N
to	N
communicate	N

we	N

got	N

a	N
national	N
security	N

well	N

And	N
that	N
's	N
why	N
we	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
make	C
some	C

I	P
've	P

,	P
geothermal	P
.	N
Contrary	N
to	N
what	N
Senator	N
McCain	N
keeps	N
on	N
saying	N
,	N
I	C
favor	C
nuclear	C
power	C
as	C
one	C
component	C
of	C
our	C
overall	C
energy	C
mix	C
.	N
But	N
this	N
is	N
another	N
example	N
where	N
I	C
think	C
it	C
is	C
important	C
to	C
look	C
at	C
the	C
record	C
.	N
Senator	N
McCain	N
and	N
I	N
actually	N
agree	N
on	N
something	N
.	N
He	P
said	P
a	P
while	P
back	P
that	P
the	P
big	P
problem	P
with	P
energy	P
is	P
that	P
for	P
30	P
years	P
,	P
politicians	P
in	P
Washington	P
have	P
n't	P
done	P
anything	P
.	N
What	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
does	P
n't	P
mention	P
is	P
he	P
's	P
been	P
there	P
26	P
of	P
them	P
.	N
And	N
during	N
that	N
time	N

he	P
voted	P
23	P
times	P
against	P
alternative	P
fuels	P
,	P
23	P
times	P
.	N
So	N
it	P
's	P
easy	P
to	P
talk	P
about	P
this	P
stuff	P
during	P
a	P
campaign	P
,	N
but	N
it	C
's	C
important	C
for	C
us	C
to	C
understand	C
that	C
it	C
requires	C
a	C
sustained	C
effort	C
from	C
the	C
next	C
president	C

One	N
last	N
point	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
on	N
energy	N

Senator	N
McCain	N
talks	N
a	N
lot	N
about	N
drilling	N
,	N
and	N
that	N
's	N
important	N
,	N

we	C
have	C
three	C
percent	C

we	C
use	C
25	C
percent	C
of	C
the	C
world	C
's	C
oil	C

So	N
what	N
that	N
means	N
is	N
that	N
we	C
ca	C
n't	C
simply	C
drill	C
our	C
way	C

to	C
come	C
up	C

it	C

projected	C
out	C

at	N

we	N
have	N
time	N

on	C
all	C

I	N
ca	N
n't	N
give	N
you	N
a	N
specific	N
answer	N
on	N
Pension	N
Guarantee	N

All	N
I	N
know	N
is	N
that	N
we	C
have	C
firm	C

credit	C

And	N
that	N
is	N
very	N
important	N

But	N
it	N
's	N

the	C
full	C
faith	C

And	N
I	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
the	C
only	C
answer	C

But	N
the	C
more	C
immediate	C
answer	C

to	C
do	C
what	C
this	C

that	C

We	C
're	C

prioritize	C
,	N
just	P
like	P
a	P
family	P
has	P
to	P
prioritize	P
.	N
Now	N
,	N
I	P
've	P
listed	P
the	P
things	P
that	P
I	P
think	P
have	P
to	P
be	P
at	P
the	P
top	P
of	P
the	P
list	P
.	N
Energy	C
we	C
have	C
to	C
deal	C
with	C
today	C
,	N
because	N
you	P
're	P
paying	P
$	P
3.80	P
here	P
in	P
Nashville	P
for	P
gasoline	P
,	N
and	N
it	P
could	P
go	P
up	P
.	N
And	N
it	C
's	C
a	C
strain	C
on	C
your	C
family	C
budget	C
,	N
but	N
it	C
's	C
also	C
bad	C
for	C
our	C
national	C
security	C
,	N
because	N
countries	P
like	P
Russia	P
and	P
Venezuela	P
and	P
,	P
you	P
know	P
,	P
in	P
some	P
cases	P

countries	P
like	P
Iran	P
,	P
are	P
benefiting	P
from	P
higher	P
oil	P
prices	P
.	N
So	N
we	P
've	P
got	P
to	P
deal	P
with	P
that	P
right	P
away	P
.	N
That	N
's	N
why	N
I	C
've	C
called	C
for	C
an	C
investment	C
of	C
$	C
15	C
billion	C
a	C
year	C
over	C
10	C
years	C
.	N
Our	C
goal	C
should	C
be	C
,	C
in	C
10	C
year	C
's	C
time	C
,	C
we	C
are	C
free	C
of	C
dependence	C
on	C
Middle	C
Eastern	C
oil	C
.	N
And	N
we	P
can	P
do	P
it	P
.	N
Now	N
,	N
when	P
JFK	P
said	P
we	P
're	P
going	P
to	P
the	P
Moon	P
in	P
10	P
years	P
,	N
nobody	P
was	P
sure	P
how	P
to	P
do	P
it	P
,	N
but	N
we	P
understood	P
that	P
,	N
if	C
the	C
American	C
people	C
make	C
a	C
decision	C
to	C
do	C
something	C
,	C
it	C
gets	C
done	C
.	N
So	N
that	C
would	C
be	C
priority	C
number	C
one	C
.	N
Health	C
care	C
is	C
priority	C
number	C
two	C
,	N
because	N
that	P
broken	P
health	P
care	P
system	P
is	P
bad	P
not	P
only	P
for	P
families	P
,	N
but	N
it	C
's	C
making	C
our	C
businesses	C
less	C
competitive	C
.	N
And	N
,	N
number	C
three	C
,	C
we	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
deal	C
with	C
education	C
so	C
that	C
our	C
young	C
people	C
are	C
competitive	C
in	C
a	C
global	C
economy	C
.	N
But	N
just	N
one	N
point	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
,	N
Tom	N
.	N
Senator	P
McCain	P
mentioned	P
looking	P
at	P
our	P

We	P
do	P
need	P
to	P
look	P
at	P
our	P
records	P
.	N
Senator	P
McCain	P
likes	P
to	P
talk	P
about	P
earmarks	P
a	P
lot	P
.	N
And	N
that	N
's	N
important	N
.	N
I	C
want	C
to	C
go	C
line	C
by	C
line	C
through	C
every	C
item	C
in	C
the	C
federal	C
budget	C
and	C
eliminate	C
programs	C
that	C
do	C
n't	C
work	C
and	N
make	C
sure	C
that	C
those	C
that	C
do	C
work	C
,	C
work	C
better	C

cheaper	C
.	N
But	N
understand	N
this	N
:	N
We	C
also	C
have	C
to	C
look	C
at	C
where	C
some	C
of	C
our	C
tax	C

are	C

So	N
when	P
Senator	P

proposes	P
a	P
$	P
300	P
billion	P
tax	P
cut	P

a	P
continuation	P
not	P
only	P
of	P
the	P

,	N
but	N
an	P
additional	P
$	P
200	P

that	P
he	P

going	P

that	C
's	C
money	C
out	C
of	C
the	C

And	N
so	N
we	C
've	C

to	C
prioritize	C
both	C
our	C

side	C

what	P
we	P
had	P
to	P
do	P
was	P
literally	P
giving	P
an	P
interview	P
to	P
``	P
The	P
Wall	P

what	C

you	C

overwhelming	C
``	C

actually	C
the	C

itself	C

As	N
a	N
matter	N
of	N

John	P

every	P

every	P

In	P
many	P

are	P

are	P

That	P
was	P
certainly	P
the	P
case	P
from	P
the	P
minute	P
I	P
got	P
there	P
.	N
So	P
after	P
Speaker	P
Gingrich	P

took	P
over	P
the	P
Congress	P

I	P
went	P
to	P
New	P

and	P
a	P
man	P
suggested	P
--	P
a	P
gentleman	P
that	P
unfortunately	P
just	P
passed	P
away	P
a	P
couple	P
of	P
days	P
ago	P
,	P
suggested	P
that	P
we	P
appoint	P
a	P
commission	P
.	N
And	N
I	P
shook	P
hands	P
with	P
him	P
on	P
it	P
and	P
I	P
appointed	P
my	P
members	P
,	P
and	P
the	P
commission	P
never	P
met	P
.	N
And	N
then	P
Senator	P
Dole	P
's	P
ardent	P
supporters	P
,	P
Senator	P

,	P
who	P
's	P
out	P
there	P
today	P
,	P
along	P
with	P
Senator	P
Feingold	P
,	P
supported	P
,	P
sponsored	P
a	P
campaign	P
finance	P
reform	P
proposal	P
.	N
I	P
strongly	P
supported	P
it	P
.	N
And	N
members	P
of	P
Senator	P
Dole	P
's	P
own	P
party	P
in	P
the	P
Senate	P
killed	P
it	P

And	N
he	P

80	C

the	C

now	C

a	P

was	C
wrong	C

I	P
gave	P
four	P

what	N
do	N
we	N

about	N

here	N
I	C
believe	C

that	C
what	C

to	C
stimulate	C
that	C
sector	C

the	C
private	C

in	N
which	N
there	C
is	C
the	C
greatest	C
possibility	C
for	C
expansion	C

So	N
that	N
is	N
why	N
I	C
advocate	C
a	C

will	C
stimulate	C
more	C

our	C

In	N

to	N
that	N

we	C
have	C
to	C
move	C
on	C

areas	C
that	C
are	C
holding	C
back	C

I	N
refer	N
,	N
for	P
example	P
,	P
to	P
distressed	P
areas	P

We	C
have	C
to	C
move	C
into	C
those	C
areas	C
with	C
programs	C
so	C
that	C
we	C
make	C
adequate	C
use	C
of	C
the	C
resources	C
of	C
those	C
areas	C
.	N
We	C
also	C
have	C
to	C
see	C
that	C
all	C
of	C
the	C

's	N
why	N

the	C
equality	C

statement	C
that	C
Quemoy	C

the	C

that	C

a	C
preliminary	C
to	C

Now	N
as	N
far	N
as	N
President	N

is	N
concerned	N

I	N
have	N
often	N

him	N

this	N
question	N

As	N
I	N
uh	N
-	N
related	N
a	N
moment	N
ago	N
,	N
the	P
President	P
has	P
always	P
indicated	P
that	P
we	P
must	P
not	P
make	P
the	P
mistake	P
in	P
dealing	P
with	P
the	P
dictator	P
of	P
indicating	P
that	P
we	P
are	P
going	P
to	P
make	P
a	P
concession	P
at	P
the	P
point	P
of	P
a	P
gun	P

Whenever	P
you	P
do	P
that	P

inevitably	P
the	P
dictator	P
is	P
encouraged	P

try	P
it	P
again	P

So	N
first	N
it	N
will	N

next	N
it	N
may	N

What	N
do	N
we	N
do	N
then	N
?	N
My	N
point	N
is	N
this	N
:	N
that	N
once	C
you	C
do	C
this	C
-	N
follow	N
this	N
course	N
of	N
action	N

that	C
you	C

not	C
going	C
to	C
defend	C
a	C
particular	C
area	C
,	C
the	C
inevitable	C
result	C
is	C
that	C
it	C
encourages	C
a	C
man	C

is	C
determined	C

the	C
point	C
of	C
no	C
return	C

And	N
that	P
means	P
war	P
.	N
We	P
went	P
through	P
this	P
tragic	P
experience	P
leading	P
to	P
World	P
War	P
II	P
.	N
We	P
learned	P
our	P
lesson	P
again	P
in	P

We	P
must	P
not	P
learn	P
it	P

That	N
is	N
why	N
I	C
think	C
the	C

right	C

including	N
a	N
majority	N
of	N
the	N

a	N
majority	N

they	C
rejected	C

in	C
1955	C
.	N
And	N
incidentally	N

Senator	P

was	P
among	P
those	P
who	P
rejected	P
that	P
position	P

voted	P
with	P
the	P
seventy	P

twelve	P

And	N
may	N
I	N
say	N

that	N
I	C
would	C
trust	C
that	C

change	C

position	C

as	P
long	P
as	P
he	P
as	P
a	P

continues	P

suggest	P
that	P
we	P
are	P
going	P
to	P
turn	P
over	P
these	P

just	C
give	C
up	C
,	C
and	C
their	C
workers	C
are	C
no	C
longer	C
getting	C
insured	C
,	N
and	N
that	P
's	P
been	P
the	P
trend	P
line	P
.	N
Or	N
,	N
alternatively	C
,	C
we	C
can	C
figure	C
out	C
,	C
how	C
do	C
we	C
make	C
the	C
cost	C
of	C
care	C
more	C
effective	C
?	N
And	N
there	C
are	C
ways	C
of	C
doing	C
it	C
.	N
So	N
at	P
Cleveland	P
Clinic	P
,	P
one	P
of	P
the	P
best	P
health	P
care	P
systems	P
in	P
the	P
world	P
,	P
they	P
actually	P
provide	P
great	P
care	P
cheaper	P
than	P
average	P
.	N
And	N
the	P
reason	P
they	P
do	P
is	P
because	P
they	P
do	P
some	P
smart	P
things	P
.	N
They	N
--	N
they	P
say	P
,	P
if	P
a	P
patient	P
's	P
coming	P
in	P
,	P
let	P
's	P
get	P
all	P
the	P
doctors	P
together	P
at	P
once	P
,	P
do	P
one	P
test	P
instead	P
of	P
having	P
the	P
patient	P
run	P
around	P
with	P
10	P
tests	P
.	N
Let	P
's	P
make	P
sure	P
that	P
we	P
're	P
providing	P
preventive	P
care	P
so	P
we	P
're	P
catching	P
the	P
onset	P
of	P
something	P
like	P
diabetes	P
.	N
Let	N
's	N
--	N
let	P
's	P
pay	P
providers	P
on	P
the	P
basis	P
of	P
performance	P
as	P
opposed	P
to	P
on	P
the	P
basis	P
of	P
how	P
many	P
procedures	P
they	P
've	P
--	P
they	P
've	P
engaged	P
in	P
.	N
Now	N
,	N
so	N
what	C
this	C
board	C
does	C
is	C
basically	C
identifies	C
best	C
practices	C
and	C
says	C
,	C
let	C
's	C
use	C
the	C
purchasing	C
power	C
of	C
Medicare	C
and	C
Medicaid	C
to	C
help	C
to	C
institutionalize	C
all	C
these	C
good	C
things	C
that	C
we	C
do	C
.	N
And	N
the	N
fact	N
of	N
the	N
matter	N
is	N
that	N
,	N
when	C
Obamacare	C
is	C
fully	C
implemented	C
,	C
we	C
're	C
going	C
to	C
be	C
in	C
a	C
position	C
to	C
show	C
that	C
costs	C
are	C
going	C
down	C
.	N
And	N
over	P
the	P
last	P
two	P
years	P
,	P
health	P
care	P
premiums	P
have	P
gone	P
up	P
--	P
it	P
's	P
true	P
--	P
but	P
they	P
've	P
gone	P
up	P
slower	P
than	P
any	P
time	P
in	P
the	P
last	P
50	P
years	P
.	N
So	N
we	C
're	C
already	C
beginning	C
to	C
see	C
progress	C

In	P
the	P

folks	P
out	P

one	N

I	C
'd	C

around	C
30	C

We	C

we	C

assistance	C

on	C
the	C

enormous	C
economic	C
challenges	C

And	N
some	P
say	P
that	P
that	P
's	P
what	P
Putin	P
intended	P
in	P
the	P
first	P

The	N
other	N
thing	N
we	N
have	N
to	N
do	N

is	N
we	C
've	C

to	C
see	C
around	C
the	C
corners	C

We	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
anticipate	C
some	C
of	C
these	C
problems	C
ahead	C
of	C
time	C
.	N
You	N
know	N
,	N
back	N
in	N
April	N
,	N
I	C
put	C
out	C
a	C
statement	C
saying	C
that	C
the	C
situation	C
in	C
Georgia	C
was	C
unsustainable	C
because	N
you	P
had	P
Russian	P
peacekeepers	P
in	P
these	P
territories	P
that	P
were	P
under	P
dispute	P
.	N
And	N
you	N
knew	N
that	N
if	P
the	P
Russians	P
themselves	P
were	P
trying	P
to	P
obtain	P
some	P
of	P
these	P
territories	P
or	P
push	P
back	P
against	P
Georgia	P
,	P
that	P
that	P
was	P
not	P
a	P
stable	P
situation	P
.	N
So	N
part	C
of	C
the	C
job	C
of	C
the	C
next	C
commander-in-chief	C
,	C
in	C
keeping	C
all	C
of	C
you	C
safe	C
,	C
is	C
making	C
sure	C
that	C
we	C
can	C
see	C
some	C
of	C
the	C
21st	C
Century	C
challenges	C
and	C
anticipate	C
them	C
before	C
they	C
happen	C
.	N
We	P
have	P
n't	P
been	P
doing	P
enough	P
of	P
that	P
.	N
We	P
tend	P
to	P
be	P
reactive	P

That	C
's	C
what	C
we	C
've	C
been	C
doing	C
over	C
the	C
last	C
eight	C
years	C
and	C
that	C
has	C
actually	C
made	C
us	C
more	C
safe	C

That	N
's	N
part	N
of	N
what	N
happened	N
in	N
Afghanistan	N
,	N
where	P
we	P
rushed	P
into	P
Iraq	P
and	P
Senator	P
McCain	P
and	P
President	P
Bush	P
suggested	P
that	P
it	P
was	P
n't	P
that	P
important	P
to	P
catch	P
bin	P

right	P
now	P
and	N
that	N
we	P
could	P
muddle	P
through	P
,	N
and	N
that	C
has	C
cost	C
us	C
dearly	C
.	N
We	C
've	C
got	C
to	C
be	C
much	C
more	C
strategic	C
if	C
we	C
're	C
going	C

all	C

challenges	C
that	C
we	C
face	C
out	C
there	C

And	N
one	N
last	N
point	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
about	N
Russia	N

If	P
we	P

reduce	P

at	C
the	C
age	C
of	C
forty-three	C
when	C
I	C
entered	C

did	P
have	P
a	P
life	P
before	P

I	P
was	P

's	C
not	C
only	C
what	C
is	C
on	C
your	C

you	C
qualified	C
to	C
run	C

hold	C
office	C

It	C
's	C
how	C
you	C
approach	C
problems	C

what	C
your	C
values	C
are	C

I	C

one	C

taking	C
a	C
look	C
at	C
my	C

they	C

I	C
approach	C

absolutely	C
massive	C

if	C
everything	C

that	C
everything	C
is	C
corning	C
up	C
roses	C

perhaps	C
the	C
vice-president	C
should	C
join	C
me	C

travel	C
around	C

his	N

he	N

if	N

's	N

I	N
'm	N

it	N
.	N
But	N
let	N
's	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
facts	N
here	N
.	N
The	P
Brady	P
Bill	P
has	P
kept	P
at	P
least	P
60,000	P
felons	P
,	P
fugitives	P
and	P
stalkers	P
from	P
getting	P
hand	P
guns	P
.	N
Senator	P
Dole	P
led	P
the	P
fight	P
against	P
the	P
Brady	P
Bill	P
.	N
He	P
tried	P
to	P
keep	P
it	P
from	P
coming	P
to	P
my	P
desk	P
.	N
He	P
did	P
n't	P
succeed	P
and	P
I	P
signed	P
it	P
and	P
I	P
'm	P
glad	P
I	P
did	P
.	N
Then	N
when	P
we	P
had	P
the	P
assault	P
weapons	P
ban	P
in	P
the	P
Senate	P
,	P
Senator	P
Dole	P
fought	P
it	P
bitterly	P
and	P
opposed	P
the	P
entire	P
crime	P
bill	P
and	P
almost	P
brought	P
the	P
entire	P
crime	P
bill	P
down	P
because	P
the	P
National	P
Rifle	P
Association	P
did	P
n't	P
want	P
the	P
assault	P
weapons	P
ban	P
,	P
just	P
like	P
they	P
did	P
n't	P
want	P
the	P
Brady	P
Bill	P
.	N
But	N
two	P
years	P
later	P
nobody	P
's	P
lost	P
their	P
handguns	P
.	P
I	P
mean	P
,	P
their	P
rifles	P
.	N
We	P
've	P
expanded	P
the	P
Brady	P
Bill	P
to	P
cover	P
people	P
who	P
beat	P
up	P
their	P
spouses	P
and	P
their	P
kids	P
.	N
And	N
this	C
is	C
a	C
safer	C
country	C

So	N
I	N
'm	N
glad	N
I	N
took	N
on	N
that	N
fight	N

I	C

uh	N

I	P
was	P
uh	P

very	P
,	P
very	P
surprised	P
when	P
I	P
read	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
Senator	P

made	P
a	P
very	P
derogatory	P
,	P
very	P
personal	P
comment	P
about	P
General	P
Brown	P
uh	P
-	P
after	P
the	P
news	P
story	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
broke	P
about	P
General	P
Brown	P
.	N
If	P
my	P
recollection	P
is	P
correct	P
he	P
indicated	P
that	P
uh	P
-	P
General	P
Brown	P
was	P
not	P
qualified	P
to	P
be	P
a	P
sewer	P
commissioner	P
.	N
I	C
do	C
n't	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
a	C
proper	C
way	C
to	C
describe	C
aayuh-	C
chairman	C
of	C
the	C
Joint	C
Chiefs	C
of	C
Staff	C
who	C
has	C
fought	C
for	C
his	C
country	C
for	C
thirty-five	C
years	C
,	N
and	N
I	N
'm	N
sure	N
the	N
governor	N
would	N
agree	N
with	N
me	N
on	N
that	N
.	N
Uh	N
-	N
I	C
think	C
Senator	C
Dole	C
would	C
show	C
more	C
good	C
judgment	C
and	C
discretion	C
than	C
to	C
so	C
describe	C
uh	C
-	C
a	C

and	C
brave	C
and	C
very	C
outstanding	C
leader	C
of	C
the	C

.	N
So	N
I	C
think	C
our	C
selection	C
uh	C
-	C
of	C
Bob	C
Dole	C
as	C
vice	C
president	C
uh	C
-	C
is	C
based	C
on	C
merit	C
.	N
And	N
if	P
he	P
should	P
ever	P
become	P
uh	P
-	P
the	P
president	P
of	P
the	P

with	P
his	P

as	P
well	P
as	P
a	P

I	C

he	C

the	C
